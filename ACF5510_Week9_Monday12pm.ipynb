The results for the 12 months ended 30 June 2019 have been restated \\non the same basis for comparison purposes. \\nThe Qantas Group reported an Underlying Profit Before Tax1 (Underlying PBT) of $124 million for the 12 months ended 30 June 2020, \\na decrease of $1,202 million from the full year 2018/19 primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 in the second half. The Group’s \\nStatutory Loss Before Tax of $(2,708) million was down $3,900 million from the prior year. The Statutory Loss Before Tax for this \\nfinancial year included a net $2,832 million of costs, mostly non-cash, which were not included in Underlying PBT. Items outside of \\nUnderlying PBT included asset impairments including the A380 fleet, Recovery Plan restructuring costs including redundancies, de-\\ndesignated hedging and costs such as those associated with transformation and discretionary non-executive employee bonuses. This \\ncompares with $134 million of net costs that were not included in Underlying PBT in the prior year. \\nIn the first half of 2019/20 the Qantas Group reported an Underlying PBT of $771 million, a decrease of only $4 million from the prior \\nyear, as revenue strength offset temporary headwinds totalling $119 million including the impact of protests in Hong Kong, subdued \\ndemand in global freight markets and other increases in costs associated with foreign exchange rates on non-fuel costs. \\nDuring the second half of 2019/20 the measures taken by governments across the world to slow the spread of COVID-19 severely \\nimpacted airlines, as travel restrictions and border closures were imposed. Because of these measures, the Qantas Group suffered a \\n$3,967 million decline in total revenue as both domestic and international air travel was virtually halted in the fourth quarter. The Group \\nquickly shifted its focus to preserving liquidity, partially mitigating the 82 per cent fall in Total Revenue in the fourth quarter through a 75 \\nper cent reduction in net operating expenses2, a good proxy for the Group’s operating cash costs. Due to the action taken, the Group \\nwas able to reduce the combined impact of COVID-19 on the Group earnings for the 2019/20 financial year to $1,224 million3. \\nDespite the grounding of most of the domestic fleet in the fourth quarter, Group Domestic4 remained profitable, contributing Underlying \\nEBIT of $285 million to the Group’s overall result. The international businesses5 fell into an Underlying EBIT loss of $82 million as the \\nrecord result from the Freight business could not offset the losses from the passenger airlines which were driven by international border \\nclosures. \\nQantas Loyalty maintained its value proposition for its members and partners despite the grounding of the Group’s airlines and was the \\nlargest contributor to the Group’s earnings. \\nThe Financial metrics for the 2019/20 financial year are: \\n–  Statutory Earnings Per Share was a loss of 129.6 cents per share, reflecting the Statutory Loss and the reduction in average shares \\non issue from the off-market share buy-back conducted in the first half \\n–  Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)6 of 5.8 per cent \\n–  Operating cash flow of $1,083 million. \\nAt the end of the first half of 2019/20, Net Debt7 was towards the bottom of the target range, the Group retained strong liquidity and had \\nan unencumbered aircraft asset base of $4.9 billion8. This put the Group in a strong financial position to weather the impacts of the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic.  \\nIn the second half, the Group’s focus turned to safely hibernating the airlines, cutting costs and preserving liquidity. The Group’s \\nvariable cost base adjusted as activity declined, with a commensurate reduction in fuel consumption costs, aircraft operating variable \\nand manpower costs as approximately 25,000 employees were stood down. Fixed costs and depreciation and amortisation non-cash \\ncharges continued to impact the Group’s profitability.  \\n \\n \\n1.  Underlying Profit Before Tax (Underlying PBT) is the primary reporting measure used by the Qantas Group’s Chief Operating Decision-Making bodies (CODM), being the Chief \\nExecutive Officer, Group Management Committee and the Board of Directors, for the purpose of assessing the performance of the Group. The primary reporting measure of the \\nQantas Domestic, Qantas International, Jetstar Group and Qantas Loyalty operating segments is Underlying Earnings Before Net Finance Costs and Income Tax Expense \\n(Underlying EBIT). The primary reporting measure of the Corporate segment is Underlying PBT as net finance costs are managed centrally. Refer to the reconciliation of \\nUnderlying PBT to Statutory (Loss)/ Profit Before Tax on Page 20. \\n2.  Net operating expenses is gross expenditure less depreciation and amortisation, on an underlying basis. \\n3.  Underlying PBT for 2H20 compared to 2H19 excluding the movement of discount rate changes on provisions and depreciation/amortisation expense. \\n4.  Group Domestic includes Qantas Domestic and Jetstar Domestic. \\n5.  International businesses or Group International includes Qantas International, Jetstar International Australian operations, Jetstar New Zealand (including Jetstar Regionals), \\nJetstar Asia (Singapore), and the contributions from Jetstar Japan and Jetstar Pacific. \\n6.  Return on Invested Capital is calculated as ROIC EBIT for the 12 months ended 30 June 2020, divided by the 12 month Average Invested Capital. ROIC EBIT is derived by \\nadjusting Underlying EBIT to account for leased aircraft as if they were owned and non-aircraft leases as if they were service costs. This is calculated as Underlying EBIT \\nexcluding lease depreciation under AASB 16 and including notional depreciation for aircraft (to account for them as if they were owned aircraft) and the full cash payment for \\nnon-aircraft leases (to account for them as service costs).

The Group and its employees benefited from a number of these \\nprograms including: \\n–  The Australian Aviation Financial Relief Package including the refunding and waiving of a range of government charges to the \\naviation industry including fuel excise, Airservices Australia charges on domestic airline operations and domestic and regional \\naviation security charges \\n–  The JobKeeper Payment, intended to help keep more Australians in jobs and support affected businesses. The majority of the benefit \\nreceived by the Group was paid directly through to employees on stand down and the rest used to subsidise wages of those still \\nworking. \\nIn addition, the Australian Government commissioned Qantas to conduct various charter repatriation flights and rescue missions, \\nincluding to Wuhan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, London, Lima, Buenos Aires, Johannesburg, New Delhi and Chennai. Along with other \\nAustralian domestic airlines, Qantas also performed several domestic, regional and international flights as part of the Minimum Viable \\nNetwork intended to maintain vital air transport links. Qantas also secured a contract to conduct freight services under the International \\nFreight Assistance Mechanism to ensure import and export freight routes remained open.  \\nLiquidity was boosted by cutting capital expenditure outflows, cancelling shareholder distributions and sourcing additional funding through \\n$1.75 billion in new debt, with no financial covenants and $1.36 billion through a fully underwritten Institutional Placement initiated as \\npart of the Group’s Three-Year Recovery Plan. At 30 June 2020, cash and cash equivalents totalled $3.5 billion with total liquidity at \\n$4.5 billion including the undrawn revolving credit facilities. Net Debt was $4.7 billion towards the bottom of the Net Debt target of \\n$4.5 billion to $5.6 billion. Importantly, the Group maintained its investment grade credit rating of Baa2 from Moody’s Investor Services. \\nThe Group’s usually strong cash flow generation ability was impacted by lower earnings and the working capital movements associated \\nwith lower revenue received in advance, lower receivables, payables (including refunds) and hedge settlements. Net capital expenditure9 \\nof $1.6 billion was invested in the business, skewed towards the first half, and $647 million of surplus capital was returned to shareholders \\nthrough $204 million of fully franked dividends and $443 million of off-market share buy-backs completed in the first half. \\nGiving consideration to the requirement to protect the strength of the balance sheet, maintain a minimum level of liquidity and the \\nuncertainty of the near-term outlook for the business, the Board has decided not to make further shareholder distributions until the \\nGroup’s earnings and balance sheet have fully recovered in accordance with the Financial Framework. The off-market share buy-back \\nof up to $150 million and the interim dividend of $201 million announced in February 2020 were cancelled in March 2020 and revoked \\nin June 2020 respectively. \\nTHREE-YEAR RECOVERY PLAN \\nThe measures taken to cut costs and preserve liquidity through the fourth quarter ensured the Group was well positioned to launch \\nits Three-Year Recovery Plan to rightsize the business, restructure its cost base and recapitalise its balance sheet through the fully \\nunderwritten Institutional Placement. A retail Share Purchase Plan was launched on 2 July 2020 consistent with listing requirements, \\nwith the $71.7 million raised providing an additional liquidity buffer in the 2020/21 financial year. \\nThe Recovery Plan is targeting a total of $15 billion in savings over the three years, including significant activity-based savings \\nassociated with the reduced flying, rightsizing benefits and restructuring that are expected to deliver $1 billion in ongoing annual \\nsavings from 2022/23. \\n   Target   \\nKey area of focus  Metrics  Timeframe  As at end of August 2020 \\nCost Savings  Restructuring benefits of $0.6b in FY21, $0.8b in FY22, $1b by FY23   FY23  On track to achieve FY21 target \\n6,000 FTE reduction  FY21  On track \\nGroup Unit Cost (ex-fuel and depreciation) 10% less than FY20  FY23  Restructuring in progress \\nDeleverage the  Gross debt reduction of $1.75b  FY23  Capital allocation is prioritising debt reduction \\nBalance Sheet \\nNet debt/ EBITDA <2.5 times  FY22  Net debt/EBITDA to peak in FY21 \\nCash Flow  Sustainable positive net free cash flow  FY22 onwards  Negative net free cash flow in FY21 due to restructuring \\nexpenses and payments for FY20 deferred payables \\nFlying activity is contribution positive (RASK-Variable cost/ASK >0)  From FY21  Disciplined restart of the network with flexibility to adjust \\nfor border closures  \\nCapex for FY21 <$0.7b  FY21  Majority of expense is for capitalised maintenance \\nFleet Management  Defer deliveries of A321neos and 787-9 aircraft  Jun-20  Complete \\nRetire 6 x 747s; 12 x A380s in long term storage  Dec-20  Complete \\nCustomer  Maintain Customer Advocacy (NPS) premium to domestic competitor  Ongoing  Measured by Qantas customer research programs \\nand Brand \\nMaintain brand and reputation  Ongoing  Source – Qantas internal research and Corporate Trust \\nResearch \\nQantas Loyalty  Return to double digit growth  FY22  Program enhancements underway to achieve growth \\nambitions \\nEmployee  Employee sentiment  Ongoing  Establishing formal monitoring system for recovery phase \\nEngagement \\n \\n9.

With the aim of generating maintainable Earnings \\nPer Share (EPS) growth over the cycle, which in turn should generate Total Shareholder Returns (TSR) in the top quartile of the \\nASX100 and a basket of global airlines10, the Financial Framework has three clear priorities and associated long-term targets:  \\n  1.

Disciplined Allocation of Capital   \\nMinimise cost of capital by targeting   Deliver ROIC > 10 per cent13  Grow Invested Capital with disciplined  \\na net debt range of $4.5 billion to $5.6 billion11  through the cycle  investment, return surplus capital \\n         \\nMAINTAINABLE EPS14 GROWTH OVER THE CYCLE \\n         \\nTOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN IN THE TOP QUARTILE \\nMaintaining an Optimal Capital Structure \\nThe Group’s Financial Framework targets an optimal capital structure to achieve \\nthe lowest cost of capital. This results in a net debt target range of $4.5 billion to \\n$5.6 billion, based on the Invested Capital as at 30 June 2020 of approximately \\n$6 billion. It is defined as net debt/ROIC EBITDA range of 2.0-2.5 times where \\n \\nROIC is fixed at 10 per cent. This capital structure optimises the Group’s cost of \\ncapital and preserves financial strength with the objective of enhancing long-term \\nshareholder value. At 30 June 2020, net debt was $4.7 billion which is towards \\nthe bottom of the net debt target range. The Group’s optimal capital structure is \\nconsistent with investment grade credit metrics. The Group is rated Baa2 with \\nMoody’s Investor Services. \\nROIC > WACC Through the Cycle \\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) for the 12 months to 30 June 2020 was 5.8 per \\ncent, below the Group’s target for value creation of 10 per cent. This was due primarily \\nto the impact of government-imposed travel restrictions and border closures impacting \\n  earnings in the second half of the 2019/20 financial year. \\nDisciplined Allocation of Capital \\nThe Qantas Group takes a disciplined approach to allocating capital with the aim \\nto grow Invested Capital and return surplus capital to shareholders where earnings \\npermit. \\n  –  $647 million was distributed to shareholders in the first half of 2019/20 through \\n$204 million fully franked dividends and an off-market share buy-back of $443 \\nmillion. Distributions for the second half were cancelled as the Group took steps \\nto conserve cash. \\nMaintainable EPS Growth Over the Cycle \\nStatutory Earnings Per Share was a loss of 129.6 cents, due to the significant \\nStatutory Loss After Tax and reduction in average shares from the off-market share \\nbuy-back in the first half of 2019/20. The Group purchased 79.7 million shares or \\n5.1 per cent of issued capital for $443 million at an average price of $5.56. \\n \\n \\n \\n10.

This was 91 per cent lower than the Underlying PBT of $1,326 million in \\n2018/19. Ticketed passenger revenue15 declined by 25 per cent as the airlines were virtually grounded during the fourth quarter. Net \\nfreight revenue increased by $74 million as increased demand for freight in the second half coincided with a significant reduction in \\navailable passenger aircraft bellyspace. Other revenue declined 21 per cent due primarily to the decrease in third-party service revenue \\nincluding catering, following the sale of the business as well as the impact of COVID-19. Actions taken to cut variable costs reduced \\ntotal underlying expenditure by $2.5 billion, which helped to partially offset the steep decline in revenue in the fourth quarter. \\nJune \\nJune  2019  \\n2020  (restated)  Change  Change \\nGroup Underlying Income Statement Summary16  $M  $M    $M  % \\nNet passenger revenue  12,183  15,696    (3,513)  (22) \\nNet freight revenue  1,045  971    74  8 \\nOther revenue  1,029  1,299    (270)  (21) \\nRevenue and other income  14,257  17,966    (3,709)  (21) \\nOperating expenses (excluding fuel)   (8,893)  (10,599)    1,706  16 \\nFuel  (2,895)  (3,846)    951  25 \\nDepreciation and amortisation16  (2,021)  (1,936)    (85)  (4) \\nShare of net (loss)/profit of investments accounted for under  (53)  23  (76)  (330) \\n \\nthe equity method \\nTotal underlying expenditure  (13,862)  (16,358)    2,496  15 \\nUnderlying EBIT  395  1,608    (1,213)  (75) \\nNet finance costs   (271)  (282)    11  4 \\nUnderlying PBT  124  1,326    (1,202)  (91) \\n \\nJune \\nJune  2019  Change \\nOperating Statistics    2020  (restated)    Change  % \\nAvailable Seat Kilometres (ASK)17  M  111,870  151,430    (39,560)  (26) \\nRevenue Passenger Kilometres (RPK)18  M  92,027  127,492    (35,465)  (28) \\nPassengers carried  000  40,475  55,813    (15,338)  (28) \\nRevenue Seat Factor19  %  82.3  84.2    (1.9)pts  n/a \\nOperating Margin20  %  2.8  9.0    (6.2)pts  n/a \\nUnit Revenue (RASK)21  c/ASK  8.99  8.85    0.14  1.5 \\nTotal unit cost22  c/ASK  (8.87)  (7.97)    (0.90)  (11.3) \\nNormalised ex-fuel unit cost23  c/ASK  (4.41)  (4.23)    (0.18)  (4.3) \\nGroup capacity (ASK) decreased by 26 per cent mainly due to the grounding of the airlines in the fourth quarter, while demand \\n(measured by RPK) decreased by 28 per cent, resulting in a 1.9 percentage point decrease in Revenue Seat Factor.

The objective of measuring and reporting Underlying PBT is to provide a meaningful and consistent representation of the \\nunderlying performance of each operating segment and the Qantas Group. The primary reporting measure of the Qantas Domestic, \\nQantas International, Jetstar Group and Qantas Loyalty operating segments is Underlying EBIT. The primary reporting measure of the \\nCorporate segment is Underlying PBT as net finance costs are managed centrally.  \\nUnderlying PBT includes the impact of COVID-19 on the operating performance of the Group. Group Revenue for 2019/20 as \\nrecognised within Underlying PBT is down $3.7 billion compared to 2018/19, which is consistent with the impact on Statutory Loss \\nprimarily due to the impact of COVID-19.  \\nLikewise, the impact of the decisive actions taken by the Group to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 including a reduction in flight capacity \\ndomestically and internationally (including a reduction in costs from fuel and variable cost reductions), workforce stand downs and \\noperational cost-out measures have also been recognised in Underlying PBT. Government support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 \\nfrom travel restrictions and border closures including the Australian Aviation Financial Relief Package, JobKeeper Payment, Minimum \\nViable Network flights and International Freight Assistance Mechanism payments, together with costs to operate or payments to \\nemployees are also recorded in Underlying PBT. \\nItems which are identified by Management and reported to the CODM bodies as not representing the underlying performance of the \\nbusiness are not included in Underlying PBT. The determination of these items is made after consideration of their nature and materiality \\nand is applied consistently from period to period. \\nItems not included in Underlying PBT primarily result from revenues or expenses relating to business activities in other reporting \\nperiods, transformational/restructuring initiatives, transactions involving investments, impairments of assets and other transactions \\noutside the ordinary course of business.  \\nThe impact of COVID-19 and the Group’s Recovery Plan have resulted in items not included in Underlying PBT, including asset \\nimpairments (including the A380 fleet), Recovery Plan restructuring costs including redundancies and de-designated hedging due \\nto significant decrease in flying activity.

In rare circumstances \\n‘black swan’ risk events can materialise, resulting in unexpected consequences such as those that the aviation industry is experiencing \\ndue to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Qantas’ operations significantly, including its strategic and financial objectives.  \\nMaterial business risks arising from COVID-19, notably liquidity risks, are being critically managed to ensure the ongoing sustainability \\nof the Group. To minimise this consequence, Management has established a Three-Year Recovery Plan to rightsize and transform the \\nGroup in response to COVID-19 impacts to guide the Group’s recovery and return to growth. As the impact of COVID-19 evolves, the \\nGroup continues to plan for a wide range of scenarios and risks. \\nOther inherent risks that can impact the Group’s operations include exposure to changes in economic conditions, changes in Government \\nregulations, fuel and foreign exchange volatility and other exogenous events such as aviation incidents, natural disasters, or international \\nconflicts. \\nGeneral economic conditions post-crisis: As air travel is closely linked with economic growth, the Qantas Group’s operating and \\nfinancial performance is influenced by a variety of general economic and business conditions in Australia and overseas. A sustained \\ndecline in consumer and business demand as part of a broader deterioration of economic conditions is likely to have a material adverse \\neffect on the financial condition and business of the Qantas Group. \\nCOVID-19 has created considerable uncertainty and volatility surrounding these macroeconomic factors, and any further deterioration \\nmay have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Qantas Group. \\nHuman resources and industrial action risk: The Qantas Group operates in a highly regulated employment market and a portion of \\nthe Qantas Group’s employees are represented by unions and are party to collective bargaining arrangements. Any significant \\nenterprise bargaining dispute between the Qantas Group and its employees, including in relation to the Recovery Plan could lead \\nemployees to take industrial action, including work stoppages. This could disrupt the Qantas Group’s day-to-day operations as well as \\nlead to reputational damage. \\nThe COVID-19 crisis has necessitated the standing down of a significant portion of employees. While the need to stand down \\nemployees will decrease over time, any significant successful legal challenge to the Qantas Group’s ability to stand down employees \\ncould likely have a material adverse effect on the Qantas Group’s financial performance and condition. \\nThe Qantas Group also has certain Key Management Personnel whose institutional knowledge, expertise, relationships and experience \\nare considered important to the continued success of the business. The loss of key personnel could adversely impact the Qantas \\nGroup’s business and future performance. \\nFurther, given employee costs represent a significant component of the Qantas Group’s operating expenses, increases in labour costs \\n(whether as a result of enterprise agreement negotiations, union action or otherwise) would likely have a material adverse effect on the \\nQantas Group’s financial performance and condition. \\nCustomer risk: The ongoing success of the Qantas Group depends to a large degree on customer satisfaction and loyalty, particularly \\nin light of the significant competition for passengers that characterises the aviation industry. \\nThe significant financial and operational challenges posed by COVID-19, the impact of the pandemic on the travel industry and the \\nresponse of the Qantas Group to these challenges could also impact customer satisfaction and loyalty. In particular, a diminution of \\ncustomer satisfaction due to the cancellation and refund policies of the Qantas Group in the context of COVID-19 may impact the \\nQantas Group’s reputation and its ability to attract customers in the future. \\nIn addition, the Qantas Group is vulnerable to longer-term changes in consumer preferences in relation to its service offerings, the \\nmarkets in which it operates, and consumer sentiment towards leisure travel. Any failure by the Qantas Group to predict or respond \\nto such changes in a timely and cost-effective manner may adversely impact the Qantas Group’s future operating and financial \\nperformance. \\nCompetitive intensity: Ordinarily, the international and domestic aviation markets in which the Qantas Group operates are highly \\ncompetitive, and growth in market capacity ahead of underlying demand impacts profitability on an industry-wide basis. Its competitors \\ninclude many major foreign airlines (including government-owned or controlled airlines), some with more financial resources or lower \\ncost structures than Qantas. This competition may increase with the expansion of existing airlines, the consolidation of existing airlines \\nand/or the creation of alliances between airlines, or new airlines entering the market. \\nAustralia’s aviation policies favour the creation of a more competitive environment, including more liberal rights of entry into Australian \\ndomestic and international markets. These policies have attracted offshore competitors (predominantly state-sponsored airlines) to the \\nAustralian international aviation market, which has further increased competition for passengers on international routes. \\nAdditionally, the Qantas Group ordinarily faces high levels of price competition in the markets in which it operates, which places \\nsignificant pressure on the Qantas Group to price match by offering heavily discounted fares. Aggressive pricing by competitors \\nseeking to gain market share can materially adversely affect the Qantas Group’s revenues and yield performance. The financial impact \\nof any discounting of fares as a result of competitive pressures is exacerbated by the high fixed costs and low profit margins that \\ncharacterise the aviation industry. The combined effect of these factors may have a material adverse effect on the revenue and \\nfinancial condition of the Qantas Group. \\n   \\n21 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nReview of Operations  \\n continued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\nMATERIAL BUSINESS RISKS (CONTINUED) \\nReputational and brand risk: The Qantas brand carries significant commercial value and the continued success of the Qantas Group \\nrelies on the maintenance of a positive reputation and brand recognition among customers, suppliers, strategic partners and governments. \\nAny negative publicity (for example, due to a safety incident, labour dispute, regulatory investigation or public customer complaint) may \\ndamage Qantas’ reputation and have a negative impact on its business operations and financial performance. \\nFuel and foreign exchange volatility: The Qantas Group is subject to fuel and foreign exchange risks. These risks are an inherent \\npart of the operations of an airline. The continued focus on forecasting and the operational agility of our aviation operations are supporting \\nthe Group to manage the residual uncertainty. Accordingly, the size of the Group’s fuel and foreign exchange risk will vary in line with \\noperational changes. The Qantas Group manages fuel and foreign exchange risks through a comprehensive hedging program. Qantas \\nwill continue to hedge its fuel and foreign exchange risk in line with this program. In early April, the Qantas Group closed out its over-\\nhedged position through to September 2020, which significantly lowered the exposure to further hedging losses in the short-term. The \\nQantas Group has some fuel hedging arrangements beyond September 2020 in the form of outright options with a base layer of collars. \\nThe collars remain subject to market price movements. There are no margin call obligations on the Qantas Group’s hedging position.  \\nCyber security and data governance: The global cyber and privacy landscape is constantly evolving and at the same time, data \\ngovernance has become an important function for many organisations including the Qantas Group. Qantas remains focused on embedding \\ncyber security, privacy and data governance into business processes, taking a security and privacy by design approach and creating a \\ncybersafe and privacy orientated culture that builds on an established safety culture. The Group is also enhancing its Data Governance \\nFramework to ensure ethical and commercial data risks are managed in addition to data protection and privacy. Qantas has a defined \\nRisk and Control Framework, aligned with industry standards, which is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and \\nprivacy of data and to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The Qantas Group\\'s cyber security and data privacy-related \\ncontrols operate to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber security and data privacy related incidents and related impacts. The \\nGroup’s cyber and data privacy risks are continuously monitored by the Group Cyber and Privacy Committee and are subject to \\nindependent assurance including for material third-party suppliers.  \\nKey business partners and alliances: The Qantas Group has relationships with a number of key business partners. In order to continue \\nto maximise mutual benefit from both a financial and customer proposition perspective, governance structures are in place to track and \\nreport performance against common strategic objectives. The Qantas Group continues to proactively build relationships with existing \\nand new industry partners through ongoing dialogue with relevant authorities and stakeholder groups. \\nRisk of increase in airport services-related costs or change in availability of airport facilities: The Qantas Group is exposed to \\nthe risk of increases in airport services-related costs (including air traffic control, airport, transit, take-off and landing fees and security \\ncharges). The availability and cost of airport facilities are fundamental to the ability of the Qantas Group to operate. \\nThese costs represent a significant portion of the Qantas Group’s operating costs and have a financial impact on its operations. Most \\nAustralian airports are privately owned and owners have flexibility to increase charges to airlines. There can be no assurance that \\nmajor airport operators will not continue to increase their fees or that the Qantas Group will not incur new costs in Australia or elsewhere \\n(for example, additional fees assessed against environmental criteria such as emissions levels or noise pollution). Further, it is likely \\nthat security and health measures around the world will continue to be increased in response to the COVID-19 experience and the \\nperceived threat of terrorism, which may lead to increases in airport clearance and security charges. To the extent that the Qantas \\nGroup is unable to pass on any fee increases to its customers, these developments could have a material adverse effect on the Qantas \\nGroup’s operational results and financial position. \\nIn addition, health concerns during the COVID-19 crisis and in the period following it are likely to impact the availability of airport slots \\nand facilities in ways that are difficult to predict. This, too, could have a material adverse effect on the Qantas Group’s operations and \\nRecovery Plan. \\nClimate change: The Qantas Group is subject to short-term and long-term climate-related physical and transition risks. These risks are \\nan inherent part of the operations of an airline and are managed by undertaking scenario analysis, strengthening governance, technology, \\noperational and market-based controls, including proactive consideration of how changing factors (including global climate policies) \\nimpact the proximity of climate-related risks. The Qantas Group has also set ambitious but achievable targets to reduce our emissions \\nby capping emissions at 2020 levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, while also investing in the development of sustainable \\naviation fuels. The Qantas Group is responding to increased demand for transparency on identification and management of climate-\\nrelated risks by aligning our corporate disclosures with the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), including \\nfurther developing and disclosing findings from the scenario analysis first undertaken during the year ending 30 June 2020. These \\ndisclosures are available at https://www.qantas.com/au/en/qantas-group/acting-responsibly/our-planet.html. \\nAn overview of the Group Risk Management Framework is contained in the Qantas Group Business Practices Document available at \\nwww.qantas.com.au. \\n22 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020  \\nCorporate Governance Statement  \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n  OVERVIEW  THE BOARD IS STRUCTURED TO ADD VALUE \\nCorporate governance is core to ensuring the creation, protection  The Qantas Board currently has 10 Directors.

It describes the Qantas Executive Remuneration Framework \\n(Remuneration Framework) and pay outcomes for 2019/20, and the intended Remuneration Framework in 2020/21, in a simple and \\ntransparent way. \\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our industry has been extraordinary. Our recovery, and the recovery of the aviation industry, is expected \\nto be long and challenging. Qantas is well placed to respond to these challenges, and we have begun implementing our Three-Year \\nRecovery Plan. The plan creates the platform for our future profitability, long-term shareholder value and preservation of as many jobs \\nas possible.  \\nRemuneration Outcomes in 2019/20 \\nDuring March 2020, Qantas updated the ASX and the media on the impact of COVID-19 on our business and our people. This \\nincluded announcing that: \\n–  The CEO and Executive Management would take no Base Pay for the remainder of 2019/20; \\n–  Non-Executive Directors would take no fees for the remainder of 2019/20; and \\n–  Annual incentives would not be paid for 2019/20. \\nIn relation to the 2018-2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the performance condition against the ASX100 peer group was not \\nachieved. However, Qantas’ three-year relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance against the airline peer group was \\nranked 1st of the 18 airlines, resulting in partial vesting. \\nConsequently, for Executive Management, 50 per cent of Rights vested and converted to shares, with the remaining Rights lapsing. I \\nwould note, however, that the sum total of forgone Base Pay for Executive Management (excluding the CEO) to 30 June \\n2020, was greater than the sum total of the value of the 2018-2020 LTIP vested outcome for Executive Management. \\nIn relation to the 2018-2020 LTIP for the CEO, the CEO offered and the Board agreed to defer the decision until at least August 2021 \\nas to whether his Rights will be forfeited or allowed to convert to shares.  \\nAs a result of these decisions, the CEO’s total pay outcome for 2019/20 is 83 per cent lower than in 2018/19. A detailed explanation \\nof the CEO’s pay for 2019/20 is provided in the Remuneration Report.  \\nThese decisions are reflected in this year’s Remuneration Report. \\nRemuneration Framework Review – 2020/21 \\nThe Board has structured the Remuneration Framework for 2020/21 to appropriately support the longer-term nature of the Recovery \\nPlan. In doing so, the Board has made the following two changes to the Remuneration Framework for the 2020/21 year only: \\n–  Changing the relative weighting of incentive plan opportunities for Executives, with a decrease in the weighting towards annual \\nincentives and an increase in the weighting towards long-term incentives. This is a pay mix change only and there is no increase in \\nthe “at target” pay for Executives; and \\n–  Aligning STIP Scorecard performance measures for 2020/21 with the Qantas Group strategic priorities in rebuilding the business. \\nAt the request of the Board, the CEO has agreed to stay for the next three years as the Recovery Plan is implemented. This further \\naligns with the changes to the weighting from short term towards long-term incentives for 2020/21. \\nIn addition, the Board has approved that effective 1 July 2020:  \\n–  The CEO will continue to take no Base Pay in July and will forgo 35 per cent of Base Pay from 1 August 2020 until 31 October \\n2020;  \\n–  The Chairman will continue to take no fees in July and will forgo 35 per cent of fees from 1 August 2020 until 31 October 2020;  \\n–  Executive Management will take a 15 per cent reduction in Base Pay until 31 October 2020; and \\n–  Non-Executive Directors will take a 15 per cent reduction in fees until 31 October 2020.  \\nThe CEO, Executive Management and Non-Executive Directors will return to full pay from 1 November 2020. \\nFurthermore, Ms Hudson commenced in her Key Management Personnel (KMP) role, as Chief Financial Officer, on 1 October 2019 \\nand her Base Pay was set at a level below her predecessor as she was new to the role. Consistent with the approach taken with \\nmembers of Executive Management to date, and following a very strong performance by Ms Hudson in her role, her Base Pay was \\nrealigned and increased to $1,020,000 with effect from 1 July 2020.  \\nThe Qantas Board remains committed to a Remuneration Framework that supports business objectives, operates sustainably and is \\nmarket competitive. I invite you to review the 2020 Remuneration Report. \\n \\n \\n \\nPaul Rayner \\nChairman, Remuneration Committee \\n31 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nDirectors’ Report    \\ncontinued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020  \\nREMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) (CONTINUED) \\n1  REMUNERATION REPORT SUMMARY  \\nThe objectives of, and approach to, Qantas’ Executive Remuneration Framework are summarised as follows: \\nRemuneration Objectives  Remuneration Effectiveness \\n– Supports Business Objectives: Encourages the pursuit of – Oversight: Remuneration governance roles clearly defined\\ngrowth and the success of Qantas.

The Board has structured the Remuneration Framework for 2020/21 aligned to Management’s implementation of its \\nRecovery Plan as follows: \\nPay Mix Change for Executives for 2020/21 \\nThe Board has changed the pay mix that will apply for Executives for 2020/21. This involves changing the relative weighting of incentive \\nplan ‘at target’ opportunities for Executives, with a decrease in the weighting toward annual incentives and an increase in weighting \\ntoward long-term incentives. This is a pay mix change only and there is no increase in the total target pay for each Executive. \\nIn addition, participation in the 2021-2023 LTIP, which normally applies to Senior Executives only, will be extended to a broader \\nmanagement population (Executives). This will involve no increase to total target pay for each Executive, as each Executive’s LTIP \\nopportunity will be offset by a reduction in their annual incentive opportunity for 2020/21. \\nThis one-off change aligns the broader Management team with the immediate priorities of the post COVID-19 Recovery Plan. \\nIn this context, at the Board’s request, the CEO has agreed to continue in his position and lead the Recovery Plan for the next three years. \\nFor the CEO, the pay remix involves: \\n–  Decreasing his target STIP opportunity for 2020/21 to 50 per cent of Base Pay (2019/20: 100 per cent of Base Pay) \\n–  Increasing his target LTIP opportunity for 2020/21 to 235 per cent of Base Pay (2019/20: 185 per cent of Base Pay)  \\nShareholder approval will be sought at the 2020 Annual General Meeting for the CEO’s award of 1,349,000 Rights under the 2021-2023 \\nLTIP. \\nSTIP Scorecard for 2020/21 \\nEach year, the Board aligns the performance measures that comprise the STIP Scorecard with the Qantas Group’s strategic priorities. \\nFor 2020/21, this involved aligning these performance measures with the key financial, operational and safety measures supporting \\nthe Recovery Plan. For 2020/21, the Board selected cash preservation and Recovery Plan metrics as the key financial performance \\nmeasures for the Qantas Group, with a weighting of 50 per cent of the STIP Scorecard. In addition, the maximum STIP Scorecard \\noutcome was reduced from 175 per cent to 150 per cent for 2020/21. Therefore, for the CEO, assuming a maximum STIP Scorecard \\noutcome of 150 per cent and an indicative IPF of 1.2, the maximum STIP award for 2020/21 would be 90 per cent of Base Pay. \\nThe Board believes that these changes to the Remuneration Framework appropriately support the Qantas Group’s key business \\nobjectives for 2020/21. \\n1.  International Air Transport Association (IATA) Press release, 9 June 2020 \\nCHANGES TO THE REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTED FOR 2019/20 \\nAs disclosed in the 2019 Remuneration Report, the Board made a number of changes to the structure of the Remuneration Framework \\neffective from 1 July 2019. \\nThese changes, individually and collectively, provide an avenue for Directors and Executives to have financial exposure should financial \\nor non-financial risks materialise, as well as an enhanced ability to clawback remuneration for Executives (both the ability to clawback \\nand quantum of equity available for clawback). \\nMinimum Shareholding Guidelines \\nWhile formal shareholding guidelines had not previously applied, Directors and Executive Management have held material holdings in \\nQantas shares. Notwithstanding this, the following shareholding guidelines were introduced: \\nIndividual  Guideline1 \\nNon-Executive Directors  1 times base fee \\nCEO  1.5 times Base Pay \\nExecutive Management  0.75 times Base Pay \\n1. Value of shareholding to be acquired over a maximum 5-year timeframe. \\nAdditional Trading Restriction Period on STIP and LTIP  \\nAn additional 1-year trading restriction is to apply to vested STIP shares and Rights that vest and convert to shares under the LTIP \\n(commencing with the 2019/20 STIP and 2020-2022 LTIP). The additional trading restriction applies both during employment and post-\\ncessation of employment. These shares are not forfeited on cessation of employment but are subject to clawback.  \\nApproach to Clawback \\nThe clawback policy has been expanded to give the Board broader circumstances in which clawback may be applied. This applies in \\ncases of financial misstatement, fraud, dishonesty and misconduct, with application on both the individual who committed the misconduct \\nand those accountable for those individuals. The additional 1-year trading restriction also provides an enhanced mechanism to enable \\nclawback of vested equity. When combined with the performance periods and the existing deferral period, this provides a 4-year period \\nunder both the STIP and LTIP where clawback could be enforced. \\n   \\n36 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020  \\nDirectors’ Report    \\ncontinued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020  \\nREMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) (CONTINUED) \\nREMUNERATION REPORT FOR 2019/20 \\nThe Remuneration Report sets out remuneration information for the CEO, Executive Management and Non-Executive Directors. \\nSection 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 requires disclosure of remuneration information for KMP, with KMP defined in Australian \\nAccounting Standard AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing \\nand controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any Director (whether Executive or otherwise) of that entity.  \\nCEO and Executive KMP (and their statutory remuneration disclosures) are listed on page 40. Non-Executive Director KMP (and their \\nstatutory remuneration disclosures) are listed on page 53. \\n2  REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE \\nThe objectives of Qantas’ Executive Remuneration Framework are to: \\n–  Support Business Objectives by: \\n–  Encouraging the pursuit of growth and the success of Qantas \\n–  Aligning with Qantas’ purpose, values, strategy and risk appetite \\n–  Aligning with shareholder requirements. \\n–  Operate Sustainably by: \\n–  Encouraging the sound management of financial and non-financial risks \\n–  Encouraging good conduct and discouraging misconduct \\n–  Considering cost and reputational factors and complying with relevant laws and regulations. \\n–  Be Market Competitive to attract, motivate and appropriately reward a capable management team. \\nThese objectives are achieved by the Board applying the following robust approach to remuneration governance and effectiveness, \\ndescribed below across the areas of oversight, structure, operation and quantum: \\nOversight  The remuneration governance role of the Board; the Remuneration Committee; the Safety, Health, Environment \\nand Security Committee; the Audit Committee; and the Board’s independent remuneration consultant (EY) are \\nclearly defined. \\nThe Remuneration Committee (a committee of the Board, whose members are detailed on pages 8 to 11) has \\nthe role of reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on specific remuneration matters at Qantas. The \\nCommittee makes recommendations it believes are appropriate from the perspective of business performance, \\nindividual performance and conduct, risk, governance, quantum and market conditions. \\nThe Safety, Health, Environment and Security Committee and the Audit Committee have appropriate input into \\nremuneration decision making. The Chairs of both committees regularly attend Remuneration Committee meetings \\nand provide input into remuneration decision making. A member of the Remuneration Committee is also a member \\nof the Safety, Health, Environment and Security Committee and the Audit Committee. \\nDuring 2019/20, the Remuneration Committee re-appointed EY as its remuneration consultant. The Remuneration \\nCommittee has established protocols in relation to the appointment and use of remuneration consultants to support \\ncompliance with the Corporations Act 2001, which are incorporated into the terms of engagement with EY. \\nThe Remuneration Committee did not seek a formal remuneration recommendation (as defined in the Corporations \\nAct 2001) during 2019/20. \\nStructure  The Framework has design elements that protect against the risk of unintended and unjustified pay outcomes. \\nThese design elements include: \\n–  Diversity in incentive plan performance measures, which as a suite of measures cannot be directly and \\nimprudently influenced by any individual employee \\n–  Individual performance being defined and assessed in terms of both achievements and conduct \\n–  The Board retaining discretion over remuneration outcomes \\n–  Clear maximum values specified for scorecard outcomes under the STIP and a challenging vesting scale under \\nthe LTIP \\n–  Diversity of the timeframes within which performance is measured, with performance under the STIP being \\nmeasured over one year and performance under the LTIP being measured over three years \\n–  Deferral of a portion of awards under the STIP for two years, with an additional one-year trading restriction \\nproviding alignment with shareholder interests \\n–  Deferral of Rights that vest and convert to shares under the LTIP, with shares being subject to a one-year \\ntrading restriction to provide further alignment with shareholder interests. \\n37 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020  \\nDirectors’ Report    \\ncontinued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020  \\nREMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) (CONTINUED) \\n  –  Clawback being available in the event of serious misconduct, breach of obligations to the Group or a material \\nmisstatement in Qantas’ Financial Statements. The Board may: \\n–  Determine that an Executive forgoes some or all awards otherwise due under the STIP; \\n–  Deem some or all STIP shares which are subject to a deferral period and/or additional one-year trading \\nrestriction be forfeited; \\n–  Cause some or all LTIP Rights which have not yet vested to lapse or LTIP Rights which have vested and \\nconverted to shares that are subject to a trading restriction be forfeited; and/or \\n–  In the case of serious misconduct, cancel any post-employment benefits for the relevant employee(s) where \\npossible. \\nOperation  The Qantas Board has a demonstrated history of aligning remuneration outcomes with performance. The Board \\nhas applied its discretion in the past to ensure remuneration outcomes are appropriate and has adjusted individual \\nremuneration outcomes based on performance and conduct. \\nExamples of where the Board has applied its discretion, including 2019/20, are provided on page 42.  \\nQuantum  Base Pay and incentive plan opportunities are set with reference to external market data, including comparable \\nroles in other listed Australian companies. Remuneration is benchmarked against ASX50 companies and a \\nrevenue-based peer group of other listed Australian companies.  \\nThe Board believes these are the appropriate benchmarks, as these are the comparator groups whose roles best \\nmirror the size, complexity and challenges in managing Qantas’ businesses and are also the peer groups with \\nwhich Qantas competes for executive talent. \\nEMPLOYEE SHARE TRADING POLICY \\nThe Qantas Code of Conduct and Ethics contains Qantas’ Employee Share Trading Policy (Policy). The Policy prohibits employees \\nfrom dealing in Qantas securities (or securities of other listed or unlisted entities) while in possession of material non-public information \\nrelevant to the entity. \\nIn addition, nominated employees (including the CEO and Executive Management) and Non-Executive Directors are: \\n–  Prohibited from dealing in Qantas securities (or the securities of any Qantas Group listed entity) during defined closed periods \\n–  Required to comply with ‘request to deal’ procedures prior to dealing in Qantas securities (or the securities of any Qantas Group \\nlisted entity) outside of defined closed periods  \\n–  Prohibited from hedging or entering into any margin lending arrangement, or entering into any other encumbrances over the \\nsecurities of Qantas (or the securities of any Qantas Group listed entity) at any time. \\n   \\n38 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020  \\nDirectors’ Report    \\ncontinued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020  \\nREMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) (CONTINUED) \\n3  REMUNERATION OUTCOMES FOR 2019/20  \\nThe following table summarises the remuneration decisions and outcomes for the CEO and Executive KMP for the year ended 30 June \\n2020. The remuneration outcomes detailed in this table are better aligned to the current year performance and are therefore particularly \\nuseful in understanding current year pay and its alignment with performance, in comparison to the statutory remuneration disclosures. \\nIn regards to the 2018-2020 LTIP, the performance measures being Qantas’ TSR relative to companies with ordinary shares included \\nin the ASX100 and an airline peer group (Global Listed Airlines), were tested as at 30 June 2020. Qantas’ three-year relative TSR \\nperformance was ranked 1st in the airline peer group and 68th in the ASX100. Based on this performance, 50 per cent vesting was \\nachieved. Notwithstanding that the LTIP conditions were partially achieved, the CEO offered and the Board agreed to defer the \\ndecision until at least August 2021 as to whether his Rights will be forfeited or allowed to convert to shares. Therefore, the CEO’s LTIP \\noutcome in 2019/20 is nil. For Executive Management, 50 per cent of Rights awarded under the 2018-2020 LTIP vested and converted \\nto shares, with the remaining Rights lapsing. The total value of the vested LTIP awards for Executive Management, excluding the CEO, \\nwas less than the total Base Pay foregone in 2019/20. \\n \\nRemuneration Outcomes Table – CEO and Executive KMP1  \\nSTIP \\nBase Pay  STIP Cash  Deferred  Other \\n$’000s    (Cash)2  Bonus3  Award3  LTIP4,5  Benefits6  Total \\nCurrent Executives               \\nAlan Joyce  2020  1,606  -  -  -  138  1,744 \\nChief Executive Officer  2019  2,149  1,172  586  6,329  (239)  9,997 \\nAndrew David  2020  749  -  -  314  50  1,113 \\nCEO Qantas Domestic  2019  999  397  198  1,582  96  3,272 \\nGareth Evans  2020  795  -  -  333  86  1,214 \\nCEO Jetstar Group  2019  1,060  467  233  1,917  61  3,738 \\nVanessa Hudson7,8  2020  576  -  -  66  169  811 \\nChief Financial Officer from   2019  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a \\n1 October 2019 \\nTino La Spina  2020  749  -  -  314  97  1,160 \\nCEO International from 1 October 2019  2019  999  419  209  1,582  21  3,230 \\nChief Financial Officer to  \\n30 September 2019 \\nOlivia Wirth  2020  635  -  -  141  145  921 \\nCEO Qantas Loyalty  2019  846  375  187  699  110  2,217 \\nTotal  2020  5,110  -  -  1,168  685  6,963 \\n2019  6,053  2,830  1,413  12,109  49  22,454 \\n1.

These are prepared in accordance with \\nAustralian Accounting Standards and differ from the 2019/20 remuneration outcomes on page 39. These differences arise due to the \\naccounting treatment of share-based payments for the STIP and LTIP. The statutory disclosures include an accounting remuneration \\nvalue for: \\n–  Prior years’ STIP awards \\nAccounting standards require STIP remuneration to be expensed (and therefore included as statutory remuneration) in financial \\nyears which differ from the year of scorecard performance.  \\nDespite no awards being made under the 2019/20 STIP, a value for STIP awards is still required to be included in the statutory \\nremuneration table. This is due to the fact that deferred shares granted under the 2017/18 STIP and 2018/19 STIP have a future \\nservice period, during which the recipient must remain employed by the Group for the awards to vest. Therefore, the 2019/20 \\nstatutory remuneration table includes a value for part of those prior year STIP awards. \\n–  LTIP awards that have not vested \\nAccounting standards require LTIP remuneration to be expensed (and therefore included as statutory remuneration) notwithstanding \\nthat the Rights have not met the performance hurdles and have lapsed. \\nThe performance measures for the 2018-2020 LTIP, being Qantas’ TSR relative to companies with ordinary shares included in \\nthe ASX100 and an airline peer group (Global Listed Airlines), were tested as at 30 June 2020.

Additional detail on the structure and operation of each element of the framework is provided below. \\nBase Pay \\n(also referred to  Base Pay is a guaranteed salary level, inclusive of superannuation. Each year, the Remuneration Committee \\nas Fixed Annual  reviews the Base Pay for the CEO and Executive Management. An individual’s Base Pay, being a guaranteed \\nRemuneration)  salary level, is not related to Qantas’ performance in a specific year.  \\nBase Pay (Cash), as disclosed in the remuneration tables, excludes superannuation (which is disclosed as Post-\\nEmployment Benefits) and includes salary sacrifice components such as motor vehicles. \\nIn performing a Base Pay review, the Board makes reference to external market data including comparable roles  \\nin other listed Australian companies. Remuneration is benchmarked against ASX50 companies and a revenue-\\nbased peer group of other listed Australian companies. The Board believes these are the appropriate benchmarks, \\nas these are the comparator groups whose roles best mirror the size, complexity and challenges in managing \\nQantas’ businesses and are also the peer groups with whom Qantas competes for executive talent. \\nThere was no increase to the Base Pay of the CEO and other Executive Management during 2019/20. In addition, \\nthe CEO and Executive Management elected to forego 100 per cent of their Base Pay from 1 April 2020 to 30 June \\n2020. It is not expected that the Base Pay of the CEO and other Executive Management will change for 2020/21, \\nexcept for Ms Hudson. \\nMs Hudson commenced in her KMP role on 1 October 2019 and her Base Pay was set at a level below her \\npredecessor as she was new to the role. Consistent with the approach taken with members of Executive \\nManagement to date and following a very strong performance by Ms Hudson in her role, Ms Hudson’s Base Pay \\nwas realigned and increased to $1,020,000 with effect from 1 July 2020.  \\nThe Base Pay for each Executive KMP is outlined on page 49. \\n41 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020  \\nDirectors’ Report    \\ncontinued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020  \\nREMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) (CONTINUED) \\nAnnual Incentive \\nSTIP Overview  The STIP is the annual incentive plan for members of Qantas Executive Management. Each year, these Executives \\nmay receive an award that is a combination of cash and restricted shares to the extent that the plan’s performance \\nconditions are achieved. \\nCalculation of   STIP awards are calculated as follows: \\nSTIP Awards \\nSTIP  ‘Target’  STIP Scorecard  Individual Performance \\n=  Base Pay  X  X  X \\nAward  Opportunity  Outcome  Factor \\n \\n‘Target’  Each STIP participant has a ‘Target’ STIP Opportunity expressed as a percentage of Base Pay, as follows: \\nOpportunity \\n–  For the CEO, 100 per cent of Base Pay \\n–  For Executive Management, 80 per cent of Base Pay. \\nPerformance  The Board sets a scorecard of performance conditions for the 2019/20 STIP (the STIP Scorecard).  \\nConditions –  \\nThe STIP Scorecard contains a mix of Group financial and non-financial measures.  \\nSTIP Scorecard \\nUnderlying PBT is the key budgetary and financial performance measure for the Qantas Group and is therefore \\nthe key performance measure in the STIP Scorecard, with a weighting of 50 per cent.  \\nOther financial and non-financial measures comprise the remaining 50 per cent of the STIP Scorecard. The Board \\nsets targets for each STIP Scorecard measure. At the end of the financial year, the Board assesses performance \\nagainst each measure and determines the overall STIP Scorecard outcome. \\nA detailed description of the STIP Scorecard measures and the 2019/20 STIP Scorecard outcome is provided on \\npages 47 to 48. \\nPerformance  An individual’s performance is recognised via an IPF. The IPF is a measure of individual performance that \\nConditions –  assesses: \\nIndividual \\n–  What an individual has achieved \\nPerformance \\nFactor (IPF)  –  How they went about it (their conduct and behaviours). \\nAn individual’s behaviour is assessed against the Qantas Group Beliefs. The Qantas Group Beliefs are: \\n–  Everyone has the right to return home safely \\n–  Customers determine our success \\n–  Being a fit, agile and diverse organisation drives innovation and simplicity \\n–  Working together in an inclusive manner always delivers the optimal Group outcome \\n–  Each employee deserves respect, trust and good leadership. \\nIPFs are generally in the range of 0.8 to 1.2. However, in the case of under-performance the IPF may be zero. In \\nexceptional circumstances the IPF may be as high as 1.5. \\nBoard   Board discretion is a key element of the design of the STIP.  \\nDiscretion \\nWhile the Board sees the STIP Scorecard approach as an important design element of the STIP, it also recognises \\nthat remuneration outcomes must be considered in the context of Qantas’ overall business performance, the \\noperating environment and non-financial considerations. Circumstances may occur where scorecard measures \\nhave been achieved or exceeded, but in the view of the Board it is more appropriate to make no award under the \\nSTIP or to deliver a higher proportion of an award in Qantas shares. Likewise, there may be circumstances where \\nperformance is below an agreed target where the Board may determine that it is appropriate to pay a partial STIP \\naward. This circumstance has not occurred. \\nTherefore, each year the Board considers whether to apply its discretion. The Board may determine that: \\n–  No award be made (as it did in 2011/12 and 2013/14) \\n–  Only a partial award be made (as it did in 2010/11 and 2012/13) \\n–  Any award will be entirely deferred and/or delivered in Qantas shares (as it did in 2010/11) \\n–  A higher proportion of the award be made in Qantas shares (as it did in 2016/17) \\n–  Any award be reduced (as it did in 2018/19). \\nFor 2019/20, the Board exercised discretion not to make any awards under the 2019/20 STIP. \\nDelivery of   No awards were made under the 2019/20 STIP. In a year where STIP awards are made, 2/3rds of the STIP award \\nSTIP Awards  would be paid as a cash bonus, with the remaining 1/3rd deferred into Qantas shares. \\n \\n42 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020  \\nDirectors’ Report    \\ncontinued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020  \\nREMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) (CONTINUED) \\nSTIP Award  No awards were made under the 2019/20 STIP. In a year where STIP awards are made, any shares awarded \\nDeferral and  would be subject to: \\nTrading \\n–  A two-year deferral period; and \\nRestriction  \\n–  A one-year trading restriction. The trading restriction would apply to these shares both during employment and \\npost-cessation of employment (shares subject to the trading restriction are not forfeited on cessation of \\nemployment, but are subject to clawback). \\nThe additional trading restriction strengthens the ability to clawback vested equity, if required.  \\nMaximum and  The maximum outcome under the STIP is capped at 200 per cent of Base Pay for the CEO and 160 per cent of \\nMinimum STIP  Base Pay for other Executive Management.  \\nOutcome \\nThe minimum outcome is nil, which would occur if the threshold level of performance is missed on each STIP \\nmeasure, if an individual’s performance does not warrant an award, or if the Board determines that no award be \\nmade. \\nPractically, for 2020/21, should the STIP Scorecard produce a maximum outcome of 150 per cent, and assuming \\nthe CEO’s IPF and each of Executive Management’s IPFs were indicatively 1.2, then the maximum outcome under \\nthe STIP for 2020/21 would be approximately 90 per cent of Base Pay for the CEO and 72 per cent of Base Pay for \\nother Executive Management. \\nCessation of  In general, Executives ceasing employment during the year forfeit any right to participate in that year’s STIP and \\nEmployment  forfeit any shares awarded under prior year STIPs that are subject to a deferral period.  \\n(plans prior to 1 \\nIn limited circumstances (for example, retirement, employer-initiated terminations (with no record of poor \\nJuly 2019) \\nperformance), death or total and permanent disablement), the Board may: \\n–  For the current year STIP, make a pro-rated award that has regard to actual performance against the \\nperformance measures (as determined by the Board following the end of the performance period), and the \\nportion of the performance period that the Executive served \\n–  For shares awarded under prior year STIPs that are subject to a deferral period, remove that restriction. \\nCessation of  In general, where an Executive resigns, is terminated for cause or is terminated in other circumstances involving \\nEmployment  unacceptable performance or conduct, they forfeit any right to participate in that year’s STIP and forfeit any shares \\n(current plan)  awarded under prior year STIPs that are subject to a deferral period.  \\nFor shares subject to the additional trading restriction, forfeiture does not apply. That is, for any shares awarded \\nunder prior year STIPs where the deferral period has been served, but the shares are subject to the additional \\ntrading restriction, the Executive retains those shares subject to the additional trading restriction.  \\nThe additional trading restriction strengthens the ability to clawback vested equity, if required. \\nIn limited circumstances (for example, retirement, employer-initiated terminations (with no record of poor \\nperformance), death or total and permanent disablement): \\n–  For the current year STIP, the Executive will receive a pro-rated award based on the actual performance against \\nthe performance measures (as determined by the Board following the end of the performance period), and the \\nportion of the performance period that the Executive served \\n–  For shares awarded under prior year STIPs that are subject to a deferral period, allow the Executive to continue \\nto hold those shares. The original deferral period and additional trading restriction continue to apply and these \\nshares are subject to clawback. \\nOn cessation of employment, a tax liability arises on shares that are subject to a deferral period or trading \\nrestriction, notwithstanding that those trading restrictions continue to apply. Accordingly, a portion of the shares \\nmay be released to assist with funding the tax liability that arises for the Executive. \\nDisclosure  In addition to required statutory disclosures, Qantas chooses to disclose the full value of each year’s STIP award in \\nthe Remuneration Outcomes Table on page 39. This involves disclosing both: \\n–  The value of cash awards made \\n–  The full value of restricted shares that were awarded (notwithstanding that these shares are still subject to a \\ntwo-year deferral period) and a one-year trading restriction. \\nNo awards were made under the 2019/20 STIP and therefore the value for the 2019/20 STIP is nil. \\nDisclosure of STIP awards in the Statutory Remuneration Table on page 40 is based on the requirements of the \\nCorporations Act 2001 and applicable Australian Accounting Standards. The STIP awards are disclosed as either: \\n–  A cash incentive for any cash bonus paid \\n–  A share-based payment for any component awarded in deferred shares.  \\nWhere share-based STIP awards involve deferral over multiple reporting periods, they are reported against each \\nperiod in accordance with accounting standards. \\n \\n43 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020  \\nDirectors’ Report    \\ncontinued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020  \\nREMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) (CONTINUED) \\nLong Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) \\nLTIP Overview  The LTIP is a four-year plan that involves an upfront award of a fixed number of Rights over Qantas Shares. If \\nperformance and service conditions are achieved over a three-year period, Rights vest and convert to Qantas \\nshares. The vested shares are then subject to a one-year trading restriction during which the shares cannot be \\ntraded and are subject to clawback. \\nIf the three-year performance conditions or service conditions are not met, the Rights lapse. \\nPerformance  The performance measures for each of the 2018-2020 LTIP (tested at 30 June 2020), 2019-2021 LTIP (to be \\nConditions  tested at 30 June 2021) and 2020-2022 LTIP (to be tested at 30 June 2022) are Qantas’ TSR compared to: \\n–  A global airline peer group \\n–  ASX100 companies. \\nUp to 50 per cent of the total number of Rights granted may vest based on Qantas’ TSR performance in \\ncomparison to the global airline peer group, and up to 50 per cent of the total number of Rights granted may vest \\nbased on Qantas’ TSR performance in comparison to the ASX100 companies. \\nThese Rights will only vest in full if Qantas’ TSR performance ranks at or above the 75th percentile compared to \\nboth the global airline peer group and the ASX100 companies. At the end of the performance period, the TSR \\nperformance of Qantas and each comparator company is determined based on their average closing share price \\nover the final six months of the performance period. \\nQantas’ Financial Framework also targets top quartile TSR performance relative to global airline peers and \\nASX100 companies. Therefore, relative TSR performance against these peer groups has been chosen as the \\nperformance measure for the LTIP for alignment. \\nThe peer groups selected provide a comparison of relative shareholder returns relevant to most Qantas investors: \\n–  The global airline peer group was chosen for relevance to investors, including investors based outside Australia, \\nwith a primary interest in the aviation industry sector  \\n–  The ASX100 peer group was chosen for relevance to investors with a primary interest in the equity market for \\nmajor Australian listed companies (of which Qantas is one). \\nThe vesting scale for both the ASX100 and the global listed airline peer groups is as follows: \\nQantas’ TSR Performance Relative to Each Peer Group  Vesting Scale \\nBelow 50th percentile  Nil vesting \\n50th to 75th percentile  Linear scale: 50 per cent to 100 per cent vesting \\nAbove 75th percentile  100 per cent vesting \\nThe ASX100 peer group comprises those companies that make up the S&P/ASX100 Index at the commencement \\nof the performance period. \\nThe global listed airline peer group has been selected with regard to its representation of Qantas’ key markets, full-\\nservice and value-based airlines and the level of government involvement. For each of the 2018-2020 LTIP, 2019-\\n2021 LTIP and 2020-2022 LTIP, the global listed airline peer group comprised: Air Asia, Air France/KLM, Air New \\nZealand, All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Delta Airlines, Deutsche Lufthansa, easyJet, \\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group, Japan Airlines, LATAM Airlines Group, Ryanair, Singapore Airlines, \\nSouthwest Airlines, United Continental and Virgin Australia. \\nReview of  The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the appropriateness of the performance measures.

The objective of measuring and reporting Underlying \\nPBT is to provide a meaningful and consistent representation of the underlying performance of the Group. The \\nUnderlying PBT target is based on the annual financial budget. For reasons of commercial sensitivity, the annual \\nUnderlying PBT target is not disclosed.  \\nUnderlying PBT is derived by adjusting Statutory PBT for items which do not represent the underlying \\nperformance of the business (such as transformational/restructuring initiatives, transactions involving \\ninvestments, impairment of assets and other transactions outside the ordinary course of business).  \\nThe determination of these items is made after consideration of their nature and materiality and is applied \\nconsistently from period to period. These items are excluded both when setting the STIP profit target and when \\ndetermining the profit outcome. As a result, Executives are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged as a result of \\nthese items being excluded. \\nWorkplace and  As safety is always our first priority, the STIP Scorecard includes an assessment of both Workplace and \\nOperational   Operational safety. In addition, the Board retains an overriding discretion to scale down the STIP outcome (or \\nSafety  reduce it to zero) in the event of a material aviation safety incident. This is in addition to the Board’s overall \\ndiscretion over STIP awards. Any such decision would be made considering the specific circumstances and \\nfollowing the recommendation of the Safety, Health, Environment and Security Committee.  \\nThe Safety, Health, Environment and Security Committee performs an assessment of both Workplace Safety \\nperformance and Operational Safety performance. \\nThe objective of the Workplace Safety targets is to reduce employee injuries. Targets were therefore set across: \\n–  Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate  \\n–  Lost Work Case Frequency Rate \\n–  Short Term Impairment Injury Frequency Rate \\n–  Long Term Impairment Injury Frequency Rate.  \\nOperational Safety performance is assessed against outcome-based measures (including operational \\noccurrences that pose a significant threat to the safety of employees and customers) and risk-based lead \\nindicators commonly associated with aviation industry accidents, such as flight data trends, Technical Dispatch \\nReliability and reporting rates. \\nCustomer  Customer service is measured against NPS targets. \\nThis is a survey-based measure of how strongly our customers promote the services of our businesses. Individual \\nNPS targets are set for Qantas International, Qantas Domestic, QantasLink, Qantas Frequent Flyer, Jetstar \\nAustralia Domestic and Jetstar Australia Long-Haul. \\nOn-time departures for Qantas Domestic and QantasLink continue to be a particular area of focus and is \\ntherefore included as a STIP measure. As agreed with and reported to the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport \\nand Regional Economics (BITRE), punctuality is measured as the number of flights operating on-time (on an on-\\ntime departure basis) as a percentage of the total number of flights operated. \\nMaximise our  Maintaining a market-leading Australian Domestic profit margin is core to Qantas’ success. Therefore, a \\nLeading Domestic combined Qantas Domestic and Jetstar Domestic Profit Margin measured as EBIT per ASK was selected as a \\nPosition  STIP Scorecard measure. This focuses on profitability irrespective of capacity levels.  \\nMaintaining our Australian domestic network advantage balances the long-term domestic network advantage with \\nshort-term profitability. This measure aligns maintaining the leading premium domestic network and the leading \\nprice-sensitive domestic network via measures of peak-hour frequency and capacity positions across key routes \\nand ports. For reasons of commercial sensitivity, these targets are not disclosed. \\nTransformation  Continuing to transform the business remains a strategic priority. Therefore, a transformation benefit target is \\nand Growth  included as a performance measure.  \\nTo support the strategic initiative of growing diversified earnings, a STIP target was set to grow Qantas Loyalty EBIT. \\nGrowing in Asia and profitably growing Jetstar Japan are key areas of focus. Therefore, a target measuring \\nJetstar Asia’s and Jetstar Japan’s Underlying EBIT is included as a STIP measure.  \\nTo support the successful introduction of the Qantas Distribution Channel, which provides agents with direct access \\nto sell Qantas product, STIP measures were set that align with the benefits to be achieved. \\nTo support the establishment of the expanded codeshare relationship between Qantas and American Airlines, a \\nrevenue growth measure was selected as a STIP Scorecard measure. \\n \\n   \\n48 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020  \\nDirectors’ Report    \\ncontinued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020  \\nREMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) (CONTINUED) \\n7  LONG TERM INCENTIVE OUTCOME 2018-2020  \\n \\nPrior to COVID-19, Qantas’ TSR Performance was positive.

The parent has majority voting rights in respect of \\neach of the material subsidiaries. Materiality has been assessed based on the expected long-term contribution of statutory profit/(loss) \\nto the Qantas Group. \\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of Qantas for the year ended 30 June 2020 were authorised for issue in accordance with a \\nresolution of the Directors on 18 September 2020. \\ni.  Statement of Compliance \\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with \\nAustralian Accounting Standards (AASBs) adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001. \\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations \\n(IFRICs) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). \\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Group will be able to meet \\nits obligations as and when they fall due. \\nii.  Basis of Preparation \\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Australian dollars (AUD), which is the functional currency of the Qantas Group, \\nand have been prepared on the basis of historical cost except for the following material items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet: \\n–  Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss and investments at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at \\nfair value \\n–  Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell \\n–  Net defined benefit asset/(liability) is measured at fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation. \\nQantas is a company of the kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 2016/191. In \\naccordance with that Instrument, all financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise \\nstated. In addition, all financial information presented is representative of the Qantas Group, unless otherwise stated. \\n(B) NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP \\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with those followed in the \\npreparation of the Group’s Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2019, except for the below which \\nhave been adopted from 1 July 2019 including restatement of comparative reporting periods: \\n–  AASB 16 Leases \\n–  IFRIC agenda decision in relation to the treatment of fair value hedges of foreign currency risk and non-financial assets (IFRIC Fair \\nValue hedging agenda decision).  \\nThe nature and effect of these changes are disclosed in Note 38. \\nIn addition, the Group adopted AASB 2020-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions, \\nwhich amends AASB 16 and became effective from 1 June 2020. The amendment provides practical relief to lessees when accounting \\nfor rent concessions directly resulting from COVID-19, by allowing entities to elect not to account for COVID-19 related rent concessions \\nas modifications under AASB 16. The Group elected to apply the lessee practical expedient, with the impact outlined within Note 16. As \\na result, COVID-19 related rental waivers are recognised as negative variable lease payments within Other Expenses. Changes in \\nscheduled lease payments due to rent deferrals have been recognised within Lease Liabilities. \\n(C) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS \\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires Management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that \\naffect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. It also requires the directors \\nto exercise their judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The estimates and associated assumptions are \\nbased on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of \\nwhich form the basis for making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other \\nsources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, as appropriate to the particular circumstances. Revisions to \\naccounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Judgements made \\nby Management in the application of AASBs, that have a significant effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and estimates with \\na significant risk of material adjustment in future periods (with the exception of those arising from the adoption of AASB 16 Leases and \\nthe IFRIC Fair Value hedging agenda decision as outlined above) are included in the following notes: \\n–  Note 1(D) – Impact of COVID-19 on Financial Reporting \\n–  Note 25 – Impairment/(Reversal of impairment) of Assets and Related Costs \\n–  Note 27(C) – Derivatives and Hedging Instruments \\n–  Note 30 – Superannuation \\n–  Note 37(D) – Summary of significant accounting policies (Revenue) \\n–  Note 37(M) – Summary of significant accounting policies (Provisions) \\n64 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n1  STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE AND BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED) \\n(D) IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON FINANCIAL REPORTING \\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the Qantas Group has been unprecedented. The section below outlines key areas of impact relevant to the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2020. Additional information on how the Group has been impacted by \\nand is responding to COVID-19 is provided in the Review of Operations on pages 12 to 22. \\ni.  Overview of COVID-19 Impact on the Qantas Group and the Group’s Recovery Plan \\nThe measures taken by Governments across the world to slow the spread of COVID-19 severely impacted airlines as travel restrictions \\nand border closures were imposed. These travel restrictions, and the resulting decrease in demand has resulted in significant capacity \\nreductions domestically and internationally. The Group took immediate and decisive action to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, \\nincluding a reduction in flight capacity (domestic and international), workforce stand downs, operational cost-out measures, capital \\nexpenditure deferrals and cancellation of proposed shareholder distributions. \\nGovernments worldwide have announced relief packages to support affected businesses, including specifically the aviation industry, to \\nmitigate the impact of COVID-19. The Australian Aviation Financial Relief package was introduced to provide refunds or waivers of a \\nrange of Government changes on the aviation industry. The JobKeeper Payment was introduced to help keep Australians in jobs and \\nsupport affected businesses. \\nIn addition, the Australian Government commissioned Qantas to conduct various charter repatriation flights and rescue flights. Along \\nwith other Australian domestic airlines, Qantas also operated domestic, regional and international flights as part of the Minimum Viable \\nNetwork intended to maintain vital air transport links. Qantas also secured a contract to conduct freight services under the International \\nFreight Assistance Mechanism to ensure import and export freight routes remained open.  \\nIn addition to operational responses, the Group boosted liquidity by cutting capital expenditure, cancelling shareholder distributions and \\nsourcing additional funding through $1.75 billion in new debt, with no financial covenants, and a $1.36 billion fully underwritten \\nInstitutional Placement. Refer to the Capital Structure and Liquidity section below for further details.  \\nRecovery Plan \\nIn June 2020, the Group announced a three-year plan to accelerate the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and create a stronger \\nplatform for future profitability, long-term shareholder value and to preserve as many jobs as possible.  \\nThe immediate focus of the plan is to: \\n–  Rightsize the Group’s workforce, fleet and other costs according to demand projections, with the ability to scale up as flying returns \\n–  Restructure to deliver ongoing cost savings and efficiencies across the Group’s operations in a changing market \\n–  Recapitalise through an equity raising to strengthen the Group’s financial resilience to recovery and the opportunities it presents.  \\nThe plan is designed to account for the uncertainties associated with the crisis, preserving as many key assets and skills as the Group \\ncan reasonably carry to support the eventual recovery. COVID-19 represents the biggest challenge ever faced by global aviation and \\nthe Group’s response to the crisis is scaled accordingly. \\nKey actions of the plan include: \\n–  Reducing the Group’s pre-crisis workforce by at least 6,000 roles across all parts of the business \\n–  Continuing the stand down for 20,000 employees, particularly those associated with international operations, until flying returns to \\nnormal \\n–  Retiring Qantas’ six remaining 747s immediately, six months ahead of schedule \\n–  Grounding up to 100 aircraft for up to 12 months (some for longer), including most of the international fleet. The majority are \\nexpected to ultimately go back into service but some leased aircraft may be returned at the end of their current lease term. The \\nGroup’s A380 fleet (12 aircraft) will be grounded for the foreseeable future \\n–  A321neo and 787-9 fleet deliveries have been deferred to minimise capital expenditure. \\n   \\n65 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n1  STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE AND BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED) \\n(D) IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON FINANCIAL REPORTING (CONTINUED) \\nii.  Capital Structure and Liquidity \\nThe Qantas Group’s Financial Framework is designed to achieve top quartile Total Shareholder Return relative to the ASX100 and \\nglobal airline peers. The Framework’s key elements are to: \\n–  Maintain an optimal capital structure that minimises the cost of capital by holding an appropriate level of Net Debt1. The appropriate \\nlevel of net debt reflects the Qantas Group’s size, measured by Invested Capital. This is consistent with investment grade credit \\nmetrics \\n–  Deliver ROIC that exceeds the weighted average cost of capital through the cycle \\n–  Make disciplined capital allocation decisions between reinvestment, debt reduction and distribution of surplus capital to shareholders \\nwhile maintaining an optimal capital structure. \\nSurplus capital is determined on a forward-looking basis, which is the difference between the projected net debt position and the target \\nnet debt position whilst ROIC remains above 10 per cent. \\nThe Qantas Group maintains access to a broad range of debt markets, both secured and unsecured. The Qantas Group maintains a \\nprudent liquidity policy that ensures adequate coverage of liquidity requirements while considering a range of adverse scenarios. \\nThe Group responded quickly to increase liquidity following the impact of COVID-19 on the business, raising $1.75 billion in new debt \\nfunding between 31 December 2019 and 30 June 2020. The Group continues to have no financial covenants on the new debt raising. \\nIn March 2020, the Group cancelled the off-market share buy-back announced in February 2020, which preserved $150 million in cash. \\nIn June 2020, the Group revoked the interim dividend, announced in February 2020 and deferred in March 2020, avoiding cash outflow \\nof $201 million. Decisions on future shareholder distributions will continue to be made in line with the Group’s Financial Framework. \\nOn 25 June 2020, the Group announced a fully underwritten Institutional Placement (Placement) to raise approximately $1.36 billion \\nand a non-underwritten retail Share Purchase Plan for eligible existing shareholders. \\nThe Placement was completed prior to 30 June 2020 with 372.7 million shares (approximately 25 per cent increase to total shares \\non issue) issued at $3.65 per share. This transaction was recorded in Issued Capital and received in Cash within the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheet for the year ended 30 June 2020. \\nProceeds from the equity raising will be used to accelerate the Group’s recovery, strengthen its balance sheet and position it to \\ncapitalise on opportunities aligned with its strategy. \\nAs at 30 June 2020, including the completion of the underwritten Placement, the Group’s available liquidity was $4.5 billion, including \\n$3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1 billion undrawn facility. \\nAs at 30 June 2020, Net Debt (as measured by the Group’s Financial Framework) was $4.7 billion with no major debt maturities until \\nJune 2021 and no financial covenants on its debt. \\nSubsequent to year end, the retail Share Purchase Plan was completed resulting in the issuance of 22.5 million shares at $3.18 per \\nshare (totalling $71.7 million). This transaction will be recognised within the 2020/21 financial year. The Group also completed the debt \\nraising of a 10-year, $0.5 billion unsecured bond issue as part of its ongoing management of its debt maturity profile. The proceeds will \\nstrengthen short-term liquidity and be used to pay $0.4 billion in bonds due to expire in June 2021. \\nThe Group continues to hold an investment grade credit rating from Moody’s (Baa2). \\nAt the present time, the Group continues to consider that COVID-19 will not impact the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern or \\nto pay its debt as and when they become due and payable. \\n   \\n \\n1.  Net debt includes on balance sheet debt and capitalised aircraft lease liabilities under the Group’s Financial Framework. Capitalised aircraft lease liabilities are measured at fair \\nvalue at the lease commencement date and remeasured over lease term on a principal and interest basis. Residual value of capitalised aircraft lease liabilities denominated in \\nforeign currency is translated at the long-term exchange rate. \\n66 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n1  STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE AND BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED) \\n(D) IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON FINANCIAL REPORTING (CONTINUED) \\niii.  Impact on Accounting Judgements and Estimates \\nCOVID-19, together with the Group’s immediate actions and responses and the strategy within the Recovery Plan have influenced \\ncertain accounting judgements and estimates impacting the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2020. \\nThe Group’s Recovery Plan has been the primary reference where forward assumptions are required to support judgements and \\nestimates, in addition to any previously existing sources of information. \\nGiven the significance of the impact of COVID-19 on the Group, the judgements and estimates informed by the Recovery Plan are in \\nsome circumstances materially different from judgements made in previous financial years. There are uncertainties about future \\neconomic and market conditions which will impact the assumptions in the Recovery Plan. \\nThe Recovery Plan assumptions have impacted key judgements and estimates within the following areas of the Financial Report: \\nArea of Annual Report  Impact on Judgements and Estimates \\nImpairment Testing  The Recovery Plan informed forecast cash flows used in the determination of the recoverable \\namounts of cash generating units (CGUs) using the Value in Use method. \\nThe Recovery Plan informed other asset specific impairments where assets will be idle or abandoned. \\nThe carrying value of investments has also been significantly impacted by COVID-19, requiring \\njudgement of recoverable amounts. \\n \\nRefer to Note 25 for further details on impairment testing. \\nFleet Strategy  The Recovery Plan informed judgements around fleet strategy during the three-year plan. This has \\nincluded around 100 aircraft to be grounded for up to 12 months (some for longer, including the \\nA380 fleet which will be grounded for the foreseeable future), early retirement of the 747 fleet, \\ndeferral of A321neo and 787-9 fleet deliveries and assumptions around aircraft lease returns \\nprovisions. \\n \\nRefer to Note 1(D)(i) for further information. \\nProvision for redundancies  The Recovery Plan informed the recognition of redundancy provisions as at 30 June 2020 for the \\nrestructuring announced on 25 June 2020. \\n \\nRefer to Note 22 for further details on redundancies. \\nHedge designation and  The Recovery Plan informed key inputs to hedging designation and hedge accounting requirements \\nhedge accounting  including forecast fuel consumption and forecast income and expenditure denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies. \\n \\nRefer to Note 27(C) for details on hedge designation and hedge accounting. \\nProvision for Employee  The Recovery Plan informed judgements around the expected pattern of usage of leave provisions, \\nEntitlements  which impacted the measurement of provisions for annual leave and long-service leave.  \\n \\nRefer to Note 22 for further details on provisions for Employee Entitlements. \\nBalance Sheet Presentation  The Recovery Plan informed assumptions around the presentation of refund liabilities as payables, \\ncurrent or non-current treatment of Qantas Points and revenue received in advance. \\nRevenue Recognition  The significant impact of COVID-19 together with strategies within the Recovery Plan informed \\n(Impact of breakage  assumptions around customer and member behaviour and customer engagement strategies which \\nAssumptions)  impacted assumptions around breakage. \\nIncome Tax  The Recovery Plan informed judgement around the recognition and recoverability of a net deferred \\ntax asset relating to income tax losses. \\n \\nRefer to Note 9 for details on Income Tax and Note 18 Deferred Tax Assets. \\n   \\n67 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n2  OPERATING SEGMENTS, UNDERLYING PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL \\n(A) OPERATING SEGMENTS \\nThe Qantas Group comprises the following operating segments: \\nQANTAS \\nGROUP \\n \\nQantas   Qantas  Jetstar   Qantas \\nCorporate \\nDomestic  International  Group  Loyalty \\nPassenger Flying Businesses and Air Cargo   Customer Loyalty  Centralised Management \\nand Express Freight Businesses  Recognition Programs  and Governance \\ni.

ROIC % represents Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) EBIT divided by Average Invested Capital. Refer to Note 2(C). \\nPassenger revenue primarily arises within the Qantas Domestic, Qantas International and Jetstar Group segments. Freight revenue \\nprimarily arises within Qantas International, except when belly space is utilised in Qantas Domestic and Jetstar Group.  \\nMarketing revenue and redemption revenue in relation to the issuance and redemption of Qantas Points is recognised within the \\nQantas Loyalty segment. Marketing revenue on inter-segment Qantas Point issuances is eliminated on consolidation. Redemption \\nrevenue arising from Qantas Group flight redemptions is recognised within Net Passenger Revenue on consolidation. The inter-\\nsegment arrangements with Qantas Loyalty are not designed to derive a net profit from inter-segment Qantas Point issuances and \\nredemptions.  \\nRedemption revenue in relation to products provided by suppliers outside the Group, such as Qantas Store redemptions and other \\ncarrier redemptions is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement net of related costs, as the Group is an agent. For the \\npurposes of segment reporting, the Qantas Loyalty segment reports these redemptions on a gross basis. Adjustments are made within \\nconsolidation eliminations to present these redemptions on a net basis at a Group level within Other Revenue and Income. \\n(B) UNDERLYING PROFIT BEFORE TAX (UNDERLYING PBT) AND RECONCILIATION TO STATUTORY PROFIT BEFORE TAX \\nUnderlying PBT is a non-statutory measure and is the primary reporting measure used by the CODM for the purpose of assessing the \\nperformance of the Group. The objective of measuring and reporting Underlying PBT is to provide a meaningful and consistent \\nrepresentation of the underlying performance of each operating segment and the Qantas Group.  \\nUnderlying PBT includes the impact of COVID-19 on the operating performance of the Group. Group Revenue for 2019/20, as \\nrecognised within Underlying PBT, is down $3.7 billion compared to 2018/19, consistent with Statutory Loss primarily due to the \\nimpact of COVID-19. \\nLikewise, the impact of the decisive actions taken by the Group to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 including a reduction in flight \\ncapacity domestically and internationally (including reductions in costs from fuel and variable costs), workforce stand downs and \\noperational cost-out measures have also been recognised in Underlying PBT. Government support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 \\nfrom travel restrictions and border closures including the Australian Aviation Financial Relief Package, JobKeeper Payment, Minimum \\nViable Network flights and International Freight Assistance Mechanism payments, together with costs to operate or payments to \\nemployees are also recorded in Underlying PBT. \\nItems which are identified by Management and reported to the CODM bodies as not representing the underlying performance of the \\nbusiness are not included in Underlying PBT. The determination of these items is made after consideration of their nature and \\nmateriality and is applied consistently from period to period. \\nItems not included in Underlying PBT primarily result from revenues or expenses relating to business activities in other reporting \\nperiods, transformational/restructuring initiatives, transactions involving investments, impairments of assets and other transactions \\noutside the ordinary course of business. \\n   \\n69 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n2  OPERATING SEGMENTS, UNDERLYING PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (CONTINUED) \\n(B) UNDERLYING PROFIT BEFORE TAX (UNDERLYING PBT) AND RECONCILIATION TO STATUTORY PROFIT BEFORE TAX \\n(CONTINUED) \\nThe impact of COVID-19 and the Group’s Recovery Plan have resulted in items not included in Underlying PBT, including asset \\nimpairments (including the A380 fleet), Recovery Plan restructuring costs including redundancies and de-designated hedging due \\nto a significant decrease in flying activity.

In accordance with AASB 9, these designations apply prospectively from 1 \\nIFRIC Fair Value  July 2019. For comparative periods before the designation (which have been restated for the adoption of \\nhedging agenda  AASB 16 and the IFRIC Fair Value hedging agenda decision) the foreign exchange movements were \\ndecision  recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. As the difference between reporting \\nperiods arose due to the timing of accounting hedge designations, the impact on the Consolidated Income \\nStatement in the comparative period has been recognised outside of Underlying PBT to ensure \\ncomparability.  \\n(C) RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL  \\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC %) is a non-statutory measure and is the primary financial return measure of the Group. ROIC % is \\ncalculated as Return on Invested Capital EBIT (ROIC EBIT) divided by Average Invested Capital.  \\ni.  ROIC EBIT \\nROIC EBIT is derived by adjusting Underlying EBIT for the period to exclude leased aircraft depreciation under AASB 16 and include \\nnotional depreciation for these aircraft to account for them as if they were owned. \\nIn addition, for non-aircraft leases, ROIC EBIT is reduced for the full lease payments rather than depreciation under AASB 16 to \\naccount for these items as a service cost. The objective of these adjustments is to show an EBIT result which is indifferent to the \\nfinancing or ownership structure of aircraft assets and that treats non-aircraft leases as a service cost rather than a debt repayment. \\n2019  \\n2020  (restated) \\n    $M  $M \\nROIC EBIT       \\nUnderlying EBIT    395  1,608 \\nAdd back: Lease depreciation under AASB 16    402  351 \\nLess: Notional depreciation1    (108)  (114) \\nLess: Cash expenses for non-aircraft leases    (225)  (187) \\nROIC EBIT    464  1,658 \\n1.

The ability to utilise the franking credits is dependent upon \\nthere being sufficient available profits to declare dividends. \\n11  RECEIVABLES \\n  2019 \\n2020  (restated) \\n$M  $M \\n  Current  Non-current  Total  Current  Non-current  Total \\nTrade receivables  335  -  335  889  -  889 \\nLess provision for impairment losses  (17)  -  (17)  (4)  -  (4) \\nTotal trade receivables  318  -  318  885  -  885 \\nSundry receivables  202  101  303  216  77  293 \\nFinance lease receivable1  2  23  25  -  -  - \\nTotal other receivables  204  124  328  216  77  293 \\nTotal receivables  522  124  646  1,101  77  1,178 \\n1.

Notwithstanding that travel credits may not be expected to be utilised in the next 12 months, unavailed passenger revenue is \\nclassified as current on the basis that the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer usage of the ticket for at least 12 months. \\nUnredeemed Frequent Flyer revenue relates to performance obligations associated with Qantas Points which have been issued, but \\nnot redeemed. Qantas Points are issued by the Group as part of the Qantas Frequent Flyer program or are sold to third parties such as \\ncredit cards providers, who issue them as part of their loyalty programs. Unredeemed Frequent Flyer revenue is classified as either \\ncurrent or non-current based on the Group’s expectation of redemption patterns by members within the next 12 months under the \\nRecovery Plan. The non-current amount of Unredeemed Frequent Flyer revenue will be materially recognised as revenue over seven \\nyears. Significant changes in Qantas Points expected to expire unredeemed are recognised within Other Revenue and Income using \\nestimates based on the terms and conditions of the Frequent Flyer program, experience, historical and expected future trends.  \\nOther revenue received in advance primarily relates to prepaid Qantas Club revenue, revenue collected on behalf of other airlines, \\nunavailed cargo revenue and incentives or grants the Group has received but are recognised over time. Other revenue is classified as \\ncurrent where it is expected to be recognised or transferred to another carrier within the next 12 months. For further details on the \\nGroup’s revenue recognition policy, see note 37(D). \\nAs at 30 June 2019, the Group had $4,414 million of current revenue received in advance which represented the Group’s best estimate \\nof the amount to be recognised as revenue in financial year 2019/20. Determining the amount of revenue actually recognised during \\nthe year in relation to balances deferred at 30 June 2019 is inherently difficult in particular due to the impact of COVID-19 travel \\nrestrictions and cancellations. In addition, customers have the ability to change travel dates or request refunds in relation to certain fare \\ntypes and Qantas Points are treated as fungible in nature. Total Revenue for the Group for financial year 2019/20 has decreased by 21 \\nper cent from 2018/19 primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. \\n   \\n82 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n21  NET ON BALANCE SHEET DEBT \\n(A) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS \\n2020  2019 \\n  $M  $M \\nCash balances  249  318 \\nCash at call  733  309 \\nShort-term money market securities and term deposits  2,538  1,530 \\nTotal cash and cash equivalents  3,520  2,157 \\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and cash on hand, cash at call and short-term money market securities and term \\ndeposits that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. \\nShort-term money market securities of $76 million (2019: $234 million) held by the Qantas Group are pledged as collateral under the \\nterms of certain operational financing facilities when underlying unsecured limits are exceeded.

The Framework’s key elements are to: \\n–  Maintain an optimal capital structure that minimises the cost of capital, by holding an appropriate level of net debt. The appropriate \\nlevel of net debt reflects the Qantas Group’s size, measured by Invested Capital. This is consistent with investment grade credit \\nmetrics \\n–  Deliver ROIC that exceeds the weighted average cost of capital through the cycle \\n–  Make disciplined capital allocation decisions between reinvestment, debt reduction and distribution of surplus capital to shareholders \\nwhile maintaining an optimal capital structure. \\nSurplus capital is determined on a forward basis, being the difference between the projected net debt position and the target net debt \\nposition whilst ROIC remains above 10 per cent. The Qantas Group maintains access to a broad range of debt markets, both secured \\nand unsecured. The Qantas Group maintains a prudent liquidity policy that ensures adequate coverage of liquidity requirements while \\nconsidering a range of adverse scenarios. \\n84 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n23  CAPITAL (CONTINUED) \\n(C) CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) \\n2019 \\n  Metric  2020  (restated) \\nNet Debt1  $4.5B to $5.6B2  $4.7B  $4.7B \\nNet Debt/EBITDA3  <2.5 times  2.2 times  1.6 times \\nReturn on Invested Capital (%)  ROIC > WACC  5.8 per cent  19.2 per cent \\nNet capital expenditure4    $1.57B  $1.56B \\nShareholder distributions    $0.6B  $1.0B \\n1.  Net debt is a non-statutory measure which includes on balance sheet debt and capitalised aircraft lease liabilities under the Group’s Financial Framework.

The residual value of the capitalised \\naircraft lease liability denominated in a foreign currency is translated at the long-term exchange rate.  \\n2.  Target net debt range of $4.5 billion to $5.6 billion is based on Invested Capital of $6 billion (2019: target debt range of $5.2 billion to $6.5 billion). The Group is towards the bottom \\nof the target net debt range. \\n3.  Net Debt/EBITDA is a non-statutory measure which is Management’s estimate based on Moody’s methodology.  \\n4.  Net capital expenditure is a non-statutory measure which is equal to net investing cash flows included in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement of $1.57 billion (2019: $1.56 billion). \\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2020, there were no new aircraft leases entered into and no returns of leased aircraft. \\n24  GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND ASSISTANCE \\nTo mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, Governments have provided businesses, and specifically the aviation sector, with various support \\npackages in the form of rebates and other financial assistance. The Group has recognised government grants and assistance where \\nthere is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with all the associated conditions and that the grants/assistance will be received.  \\nPackages  Description \\nMinimum Viable Network  This package is underwritten by the Australian Government. The Group operated a series of domestic, \\nand Government  regional and international flights on behalf of the Australian Government to maintain critical links that \\nRepatriation Flights   had been made commercially unviable by COVID-related travel restrictions. The international network \\nRecognised within Net  included flights to London, Los Angeles, Auckland and Hong Kong. Within Australia it includes a \\nPassenger Revenue  baseline network of domestic passenger flights servicing the most critical metropolitan and regional \\nroutes while providing freight belly space capacity. In addition, the Australian Government \\ncommissioned Qantas to conduct various charter repatriation flights and rescue flights. The Minimum \\nViable Network and government repatriation flights were operated on a fee-for-service basis, with fare \\nrevenue offsetting the cost to the taxpayer. Income of $192 million was recognised in the Consolidated \\nIncome Statement. The costs to operate these flights were recognised primarily in manpower and staff-\\nrelated costs, aircraft operating variable, fuel, depreciation and amortisation and other expenses. \\nInternational Freight  This mechanism is intended to restore critical global supply chains which have been heavily impacted \\nAssistance Mechanism  by COVID-19 containment measures around the world and ensures exporters maintain connectivity to \\nRecognised within Net  strategic markets. On 3 July 2020, the government announced an extension of the program to the end \\nFreight Revenue  of 2020. Income of $20 million was recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The costs to \\noperate these flights were recognised primarily in manpower and staff-related costs, aircraft operating \\nvariable, fuel, depreciation and amortisation and other expenses. \\nJobKeeper Payment  This payment is intended to help keep more Australians in jobs and support businesses affected by the \\nRecognised within  significant economic impact of COVID-19. The existing JobKeeper Payment will remain in place until \\nmanpower and staff-related  27 September 2020. On 21 July 2020, the government announced the extension of the JobKeeper \\nexpenses  payment to 28 March 2021 at modified rates and eligibility. The JobKeeper payment is recorded net of \\nmanpower related expenses. As one of the most heavily impacted companies, the Qantas Group \\ncollected $267 million in JobKeeper payments, the majority of which was paid directly to employees on \\nstand down and the rest used to subsidise wages of those still working. \\nSingapore Job  The Job Support Scheme provides wage support to employers, helping enterprises retain their local \\nSupport Scheme  employees (Singapore citizens and permanent residents) during this period of economic uncertainty. \\nRecognised within  Payments under the scheme offset and protected local employees\\' wages of $5 million. \\nmanpower and staff-related \\nexpenses \\nAustralian Airline  Includes the refunding and ongoing waiving of a range of government charges on the industry including \\nFinancial Relief Package1  aviation fuel excise, Airservices Australia charges on domestic airline operations and domestic and \\nRecognised within Aircraft  regional aviation security charges. Applicable charges applying to flights between 1 February 2020 and \\nOperating Variable  31 December 2020 are eligible for consideration in accordance with the eligibility criteria and related \\nexpenses  information set out in the grant opportunity guidelines. Under this package, the Group received direct \\nbenefits of $36 million in the financial year. \\nNew Zealand Aviation  Includes financial support to airlines to pay passenger-based government charges and to cover \\nRelief Package  Airways related fees from 1 March 2020 to 31 August 2020 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. \\nRecognised within Aircraft  Benefits of $5 million were recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, offsetting related costs. \\nOperating Variable \\nexpenses \\n1.   The Australian Airline Financial Relief Package also provided support to other suppliers of the Group (including government-owned corporations). As a result of this support, the \\nproviders have provided waivers to the Group of $52 million up to 30 June 2020.   \\n85 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n25  IMPAIRMENT/(REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT) OF ASSETS AND RELATED COSTS  \\n(A) IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF CASH GENERATING UNITS \\nGiven the significant impact of COVID-19, Management has assessed that there are indicators of impairment of the Group’s CGUs and \\nhas undertaken the following: \\n–  Reassessed the identification of the Group’s CGUs \\n–  Completed an impairment test of the Group’s CGUs \\n–  Tested specific individual assets for impairment where they are not expected to contribute to the cash flows of the CGUs under the \\nRecovery Plan. \\ni.  Reassessment of Identification of CGUs \\nThe identification of an asset’s CGU is a critical judgement in performing an impairment test. CGUs are the lowest identifiable group of \\nassets that generate largely independent cash inflows and are determined based on how performance is monitored and how decisions \\nto acquire and dispose of the Group’s assets and operations are made.  \\nGiven the significant impacts of COVID-19, Management reviewed the identification of CGUs with regards to airlines within the Jetstar \\nGroup. The closure of international borders and different considerations for re-opening, together with differences in the recovery profile \\nfor each individual airline has impacted the Group’s assessment of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate largely \\nindependent cash inflows. As a result, the Group has assessed Jetstar Japan, Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Pacific and Jetstar Australia/New \\nZealand as separate CGUs in the 2019/20 financial year. \\nThe identified CGUs by Operating Segment for the 2019/20 financial year and for the 2018/19 financial year are outlined in the table \\nbelow.  \\nCGUs Identified  CGUs Identified \\nOperating Segment  Financial year 2019/20  Financial year 2018/19 \\nQantas Domestic  Qantas Domestic CGU  Qantas Domestic CGU \\nQantas International CGU  Qantas International CGU \\nQantas International \\nQantas Freight CGU  Qantas Freight CGU \\nJetstar Asia CGU  Jetstar Group CGU \\nJetstar Pacific CGU \\nJetstar Group \\nJetstar Japan CGU \\nJetstar Australia/New Zealand CGU \\nQantas Loyalty  Qantas Loyalty CGU  Qantas Loyalty CGU \\nii.  Impairment Testing \\nAASB 136 Impairment of Assets requires the assessment at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is any indication that \\nan asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable \\namount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. \\nThe recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset where possible; otherwise, the recoverable amount of the CGU to which \\nthe asset belongs to shall be determined. \\nValue in use is the present value of the future cash inflows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU.  \\nFair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market \\nparticipants at the measurement date, less the incremental costs directly attributed to disposal. \\nWhere the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable \\namount through the recognition of an impairment loss. \\nImpairment Test of Individual Assets (where not expected to contribute to the cash flows of the CGUs under the Recovery Plan) \\nAircraft and related spares, inventory and contractual commitments \\nWith the impact of COVID-19 and the closure of international borders, the Group’s A380 fleet is expected to be grounded for the \\nforeseeable future. The A380 fleet, however, does not meet the requirements to be classified as Assets Held for Sale as they are not \\navailable for sale. Given the significant uncertainty around the return to service of the fleet, the cash flows of the Qantas International \\nCGU within the Recovery Plan do not include cash flows relating to the A380 assets. The A380 fleet has therefore been tested for \\nimpairment outside of the Qantas International CGU. \\nThe recoverable amount of the A380 fleet was determined using a fair value less costs of disposal model. The fair value less costs of \\ndisposal was estimated based on valuations provided by two external and independent aircraft valuers (AVAC and AVITAS), translated \\nat 30 June 2020 AUD/USD exchange rates. The Group has made necessary adjustments to these valuations for the level of maintenance \\nlife remaining on the aircraft. \\nThe recoverable amount of the A380 fleet, including spares and inventory and the impact of onerous contractual obligations is below \\ntheir carrying value. The carrying value has been impaired to the recoverable amount. \\nThe Group has also announced the early retirement of the remaining 747 fleet. The 747 fleet has been recognised as Assets Held for \\nSale as at 30 June 2020 and impaired to their fair value less cost to sell as their sale is highly probable.  \\nThe impaired carrying value of the A380 fleet and the 747 fleet are not allocated to the Qantas International CGU and therefore have \\nno further impact on the assessment of impairment for the remaining Qantas International CGU assets outlined below. \\n86 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements   \\n continued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n25  IMPAIRMENT/(REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT) OF ASSETS AND RELATED COSTS (CONTINUED) \\n(A) IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF CASH GENERATING UNITS (CONTINUED) \\nii.  Impairment Testing (continued) \\nProperty, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets under construction \\nThe Group’s response to COVID-19 within the Recovery Plan has included a reduction in forward capital expenditure. This has \\nchanged previous assumptions with regards to Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets under construction. Where the \\nGroup is no longer expected to complete Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets under construction and these assets have \\nno alternative use under the Recovery Plan, these assets are tested for impairment separately. Where the definition of an ‘asset’ under \\nAASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment and AASB 138 Intangible Assets is no longer met, or the recoverable amount is below the \\ncarrying value, an impairment has been recognised. \\nImpairment Test of CGUs \\nThe impairment test for CGUs includes the allocation of assets to identified CGUs and the determination of the recoverable amount of \\nthe CGU based on their value in use. Outlined below are the significant assumptions applied in the determination of recoverable \\namount. \\nSignificant \\nAssumption  How it was Determined \\nCalculation of  The recoverable amounts of CGUs were determined based on their value in use. The value in use was \\nRecoverable  determined by discounting the future cash flows forecast in the Recovery Plan. \\nAmount \\nIndividual Assets  Assets that have been tested for impairment individually are not allocated to CGUs. As outlined above, the \\nTested Separately  impaired carrying value of the A380 fleet and 747 fleet are not allocated to the Qantas International CGU and \\ntherefore have not impacted the assessment of impairment for the remaining Qantas International CGU assets.  \\nRecovery Plan   The Group’s Recovery Plan was developed with reference to expected demand scenarios domestically and \\ninternationally. The Recovery Plan includes the strategy to rightsize and restructure the business to accelerate \\nrecovery and to partially offset revenue lost as a result of the impact of COVID-19. The Recovery Plan targets \\n$15 billion in benefits over three years comprising: \\n–  $2.4 billion of restructuring benefits, with some benefits to continue to flow in future years  \\n–  Initial $2.6 billion rightsizing initiatives to reduce the workforce and supplier costs whilst activity is low \\n–  $4.0 billion in direct savings as a result of activity reductions  \\n–  $6.0 billion of activity-based fuel savings  \\nThe long-term annual ongoing restructuring benefit to the Group of the Recovery Plan is estimated to be $1 \\nbillion from FY23 onwards. The Group estimates total costs of $1 billion to deliver the ongoing restructuring \\nand rightsizing benefits. \\nThe restructuring plan includes a range of capital expenditure and fleet decisions to improve cash flow such as: \\n–  Qantas’ A380 fleet (12 aircraft) will be grounded for the foreseeable future  \\n–  A321neo and 787-9 fleet deliveries have been deferred to meet the Group’s requirements \\nPeriod of Cash  The Group’s Recovery Plan is a three-year plan. For the purposes of performing an impairment test under \\nFlows Forecast  AASB 136, the Group has made adjustments to the Recovery Plan as necessary for committed \\ntransformation initiatives at 30 June 2020. The third year of the Recovery Plan has been used to inform the \\ndetermination of the terminal year. Given the uncertainty of the impact and timing of COVID-19, the Group \\nhas adjusted the cash flow forecast under the Recovery Plan for these uncertainties rather than adjusting \\nthe discount rate. \\nCash Flows  Cash flows were projected based on the Board-approved Recovery Plan. To determine the terminal values \\nfor each CGU, a constant growth rate of 2.5 per cent per annum was used by Management where \\nappropriate. This assumption is considered reasonable by Management, as it does not exceed the long-term \\naverage growth rate for the industry. Cash outflows include capital and maintenance expenditure for the \\npurchase of aircraft and other property, plant and equipment. These cash outflows do not include capital \\nexpenditure that enhances the current performance of assets and related cash flows have been treated \\nconsistently. \\nImpact of COVID-19  As the impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve, it is extremely challenging to predict the full extent and \\non Substantial  duration of the impact on the Group’s operations. \\nOperations  Under the Group’s Recovery Plan, the Group has assumed that domestic operations will recover to their pre-\\nCOVID-19 levels by the end of 2020/21 financial year. International recovery is anticipated to be slower, with \\nonly approximately 50 per cent of pre-COVID-19 capacity expected in the 2021/22 financial year. Changes \\nin the duration and impact of COVID-19 may change these assumptions. \\nDiscount Rate  A pre-tax discount rate of 10 per cent per annum has been used in discounting the projected cash flows of \\nthe CGUs, reflecting a market estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of the Qantas Group \\n(2019: 10 per cent per annum). Given the uncertainty of the impact and timing of COVID-19, the Group has \\nadjusted the cash flows under the Recovery Plan for these uncertainties rather than the discount rate.  \\n87 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n25  IMPAIRMENT/(REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT) OF ASSETS AND RELATED COSTS (CONTINUED) \\n(A) IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF CASH GENERATING UNITS (CONTINUED) \\nii.  Impairment Testing (continued) \\nSignificant \\nAssumption  How it was Determined \\nForeign exchange  AUD/USD: 0.69 \\nrate used \\nSensitivity to  Pre-COVID-19, the Group was reporting ROIC in excess of the Group’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital. \\nSignificant Changes  For example, the 12-month ROIC as at 31 December 2019 was 19.6 per cent, and as at 30 June 2019 was \\nin Assumptions  19.2 per cent, compared to the Group’s WACC of 10 per cent. This, combined with an assessment of other \\nfactors under AASB 136, evidenced that pre-COVID-19 there were no indicators of impairment of the Group’s \\nCGUs. \\nSensitivity to changes in cash flows (CGUs other than Jetstar CGUs in Asia) \\nThe terminal year in the impairment test is informed by reference to pre-COVID-19 performance of the CGUs \\nand has the most material impact on the determination of the recoverable amount and of the surplus between \\nthe recoverable amount and carrying value of CGUs. The earlier years in the Recovery Plan, while impacting \\nthe measurement of the recoverable amount, do not materially impact the surplus identified. \\nAs such, reasonable possible changes in the short-term to the timing of domestic and international recovery \\nare unlikely to result in impairment of the CGUs, assuming that the overall recovery expectations of returning \\nto pre-COVID-19 levels remain. The terminal value cash flow is in excess of the break-even cash flow and \\nreasonable possible changes in this assumption do not result in impairment. \\nSensitivity to changes in cash flows (Jetstar CGUs in Asia) \\nAs outlined below, the Group recognised impairment of the Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in \\nthe Jetstar Asia CGU. This impairment resulted from the recoverable amount being below the carrying value \\nof assets allocated to the CGU. Reasonable possible changes in forecast cash flows would further reduce the \\nestimated recoverable amount below the remaining carrying value of the CGU. Goodwill and indefinite lived \\nintangible assets have been fully impaired, so any further impairment would be assessed for allocation to \\nProperty, Plant & Equipment.

The Qantas Group manages \\nthese risk exposures using various financial instruments, governed by a set of policies approved by the Board. The Qantas Group’s \\npolicy is not to enter into, issue or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. \\nThe Qantas Group uses different methods to assess and manage different types of financial risk to which it is exposed. These methods \\ninclude correlations between risk types, sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchange and other price risks, and ageing \\nanalysis and sensitivity analysis for liquidity and credit risk.

Liquidity Risk \\nNature of the risk: \\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities.  \\nLiquidity risk management: \\nThe Qantas Group manages liquidity risk by targeting a minimum liquidity level, ensuring long-term commitments are managed with \\nrespect to forecast available cash inflows, maintaining access to a variety of additional funding sources, including commercial paper \\nand standby facilities, managing maturity profiles and maintaining an unencumbered pool of assets. Qantas may from time to time seek \\nto purchase and retire outstanding debt through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or \\notherwise. Any such repurchases would depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and possibly other factors. \\nThe impact of COVID-19 has seen the Qantas Group take swift action to boost liquidity by unlocking value in the Group’s \\nunencumbered asset base and accessing a variety of funding sources, while also maintaining minimal refinancing risk with no major \\nmaturities until June 2021.  \\nThe Group responded quickly to increase liquidity by raising $1.75 billion in new secured debt funding since 31 December 2019. The \\nGroup continues to have no financial covenants while raising new debt at competitive rates with long tenors. \\nIn March 2020, the Group cancelled the off-market share buy-back announced in February 2020, which preserved $150 million in cash. \\nIn June 2020, the Group revoked the interim dividend, announced in February 2020 and deferred in March 2020, avoiding cash outflow \\nof $201 million.  \\nOn 25 June 2020, the Group announced a fully underwritten Institutional Placement (Placement) to raise approximately $1.36 billion \\nand a non-underwritten retail Share Purchase Plan for eligible existing shareholders. \\nAs at 30 June 2020, including the completion of the underwritten Placement, the Group’s available liquidity was $4.5 billion, including \\n$3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1 billion in standby facilities maturing in financial year 2022/23 and 2023/24. In addition \\nto this, the Group maintains an unencumbered asset base of approximately $2.5 billion, including 46 per cent of the Group’s fleet, land, \\nspare engines and other assets. \\n   \\n91 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n27  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) \\n(A) RISKS (CONTINUED) \\ni.

The Group also completed the debt raising of a 10-year, $0.5 billion in unsecured bonds as part of ongoing \\nmanagement of its debt maturity profile. The proceeds will strengthen short-term liquidity and be used to pay $0.4 billion in bonds due \\nto expire in June 2021. The Group continues to have no financial covenants on any of its debt.

This represents the Group’s contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to leases. \\n2.  Recognised financial liability maturity values are shown pre-hedging. \\nii.  Interest Rate Risk \\nNature of the risk: \\nInterest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in \\nmarket interest rates. The Qantas Group has exposure to movements in interest rates arising from its portfolio of interest rate sensitive \\nassets and liabilities, which are predominantly in AUD and USD currencies. These principally include corporate debt, leases and cash.  \\nManagement of interest rate risk: \\nThe Qantas Group manages interest rate risk by using a floating versus fixed rate debt framework. The relative mix of fixed and floating \\ninterest rate funding is managed by using interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options. As at 30 June 2020, interest-bearing \\nliabilities amounted to $6,693 million (2019: $5,137 million). The fixed/floating split is 40 per cent and 60 per cent respectively (2019: \\n56 per cent and 44 per cent). As noted in Note 23(C), the Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk with reference to the \\nGroup’s Financial Framework where the fixed/floating ratio is measured against Net Debt. The Group’s Net Debt is a non-statutory \\nmeasure and includes on balance sheet debt, cash and capitalised aircraft lease liabilities. The ratio of fix/floating on Net Debt is 78 per \\ncent and 22 per cent respectively, which assumes cash is treated as floating. As at 30 June 2020, other financial assets and liabilities \\nincluded derivative financial instruments relating to debt obligations and future interest payments totalling $7 million (liability) (2019: \\n$17 million (liability)). These are recognised at fair value. \\n   \\n92 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements   \\n continued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n27  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) \\n(A) RISKS (CONTINUED) \\nii.

Equity (Before Tax) does not include sensitivity recognised in Profit/(Loss) Before Tax. \\n2.  Sensitivity analysis assumes hedge designations as at 30 June 2020 remain unchanged. \\n \\nUnder AASB 16, interest rate movements on lease liabilities are treated as modifications against the corresponding right of use asset \\nand lease liability. As such, there is no immediate impact to the Consolidated Income Statement or Other Comprehensive Income and \\nas a result, interest rate movements on lease liabilities are not included as an interest rate sensitivity. \\niii.  Foreign Exchange Risk \\nNature of the risk: \\nForeign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that \\nis not the functional currency of the Group. The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk, primarily the \\nUS dollar. The source and nature of this risk arises from operations, capital expenditure and revaluation risk. The revaluation risk \\nprimarily exists in interest bearing liabilities, lease liabilities and other financial assets and liabilities. The Group hedges foreign \\nexchange risk with the objective of minimising volatility of the Australian currency cost of highly probable forecast purchases and \\ndisposals of property, plant and equipment and other revenue and operating expenditures. Foreign exchange losses/(gains) for the \\nyear ended 30 June 2020 was ($46) million (2019: $130 million). \\nManagement of foreign exchange risk: \\nForward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are used to hedge a portion of net foreign currency exposures in accordance \\nwith Qantas Group policy. Net foreign currency exposures, including foreign currency purchases and disposals of property, plant and \\nequipment, may be hedged out to two years within specific parameters. Any hedging outside these parameters requires approval by \\nthe Board. For the year ended 30 June 2020, other financial assets and liabilities included derivative financial instruments relating to \\nthe hedging of future capital expenditure payments totalling $15 million (net asset) (2019: $16 million (net asset)) and relating to the \\nhedging of future operating expenditure payments totalling $15 million (net asset) (2019: nil). These are recognised at fair value. \\nNon-derivative financial liabilities including interest-bearing liabilities and lease liabilities are designated in a cash flow hedge \\nrelationship to hedge forecast foreign currency revenue. These interest-bearing liabilities and lease liabilities have a maturity between \\none and 7 years. To the extent a foreign exchange gain or loss is incurred, and the cash flow hedge is deemed effective, this is \\ndeferred until the revenue is realised. As at 30 June 2020, total unrealised foreign exchange losses on hedges of revenue designated \\nto non-derivative financial liabilities was $3 million (2019: nil). \\nSensitivity to foreign exchange risk: \\nProfit Before Tax  Equity (Before Tax)1 \\n2019   2019  \\n$M  2020  (restated)  2020  (restated) \\n20% movement in Foreign Exchange Risk2,3          \\n20% (2019: 20%) USD depreciation  (68)  (249)  (373)  (114) \\n20% (2019: 20%) USD appreciation  99  379  610  156 \\n1.  Equity (Before Tax) does not include sensitivity recognised in Profit/(Loss) Before Tax.  \\n2.  Sensitivity analysis assumes hedge designations as at 30 June 20 remain unchanged. Sensitivity analysis on foreign currency pairs of 20 per cent represent recent volatile market \\nconditions.  \\n3.  Sensitivity analysis includes foreign currency interest-bearing liabilities, lease liabilities and derivatives. \\nFollowing the adoption of AASB 16 and the IFRIC Fair Value hedging agenda decision, the Group put in place accounting hedge \\ndesignations to manage the foreign exchange movements of foreign currency revenue by designating foreign currency interest-bearing \\nliabilities and lease liabilities as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge relationship. The effective portion of the foreign exchange \\nrevaluation of the hedging instrument is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and is recycled to the Consolidated Income \\nStatement within Net Passenger Revenue when the hedged item is realised. In accordance with AASB 9, these designations apply \\nprospectively from 1 July 2019. For comparative periods before the designation (which have been restated for the adoption of AASB 16 \\nand the IFRIC Fair Value hedging agenda decision), the foreign exchange movements were recognised immediately in the \\nConsolidated Income Statement within Other Expenses.  \\n   \\n93 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n27  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) \\n(A) RISKS (CONTINUED) \\niv.  Fuel Price Risk \\nNature of the risk: \\nExposure of future AUD fuel costs to unfavourable USD-denominated price and foreign exchange movements. \\nManagement of future AUD fuel costs risk: \\nThe Qantas Group uses options and swaps on jet kerosene, gasoil and crude oil to hedge exposure to movements in the USD price of \\naviation fuel. Qantas considers the crude component to be a separately identifiable and measurable component of aviation fuel. In \\nidentifying this component, the Group considers long-term correlation levels between crude hedging products and the underlying jet \\nfuel exposure. The foreign exchange risk in the total fuel cost is separately hedged using foreign exchange contracts and currency \\noptions. Hedging is conducted in accordance with Qantas Group policy. Fuel consumption out to two years may be hedged within \\nspecific parameters, with any hedging outside these parameters requiring approval by the Board. For the year ended 30 June 2020, \\nother financial assets and liabilities included fuel and foreign exchange derivatives totalling $57 million (net liability) (2019: $286 million \\n(net asset)). These are recognised at fair value.  \\nSensitivity to foreign exchange and fuel price risk: \\nProfit Before Tax  Equity (Before Tax)1 \\n$M  2020  2019  2020  2019 \\n20% movement in AUD fuel costs2         \\n20% (2019: 20%) USD depreciation, 20% (2019: 20%) increase per  41  -  30  322 \\nbarrel in fuel indices \\n20% (2019: 20%) USD appreciation, 20% (2019: 20%) decrease per  (29)  -  42  93 \\nbarrel in fuel indices \\n1.

Sensitivity analysis on foreign currency pairs and fuel indices of 20 per cent represent \\nrecent volatile market conditions. Sensitivity analysis assumes an offset between USD and fuel price indices based on observed market movements.  \\n \\nv.  Credit Risk \\nNature of the risk: \\nCredit risk is the potential loss from a transaction in the event of default by the counterparty during the term of the transaction or on \\nsettlement of the transaction. The Group has credit exposure in respect of trade receivables and other financial instruments in the \\nordinary course of business. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of financial assets. \\nManagement of credit risk: \\nThe Qantas Group conducts transactions with the following major types of counterparties: \\n–  Trade debtor counterparties: The credit risk is the recognised amount, net of any impairment losses. As at 30 June 2020, trade \\ndebtors amounted to $318 million (2019: $885 million). The Qantas Group has credit risk associated with travel agents, codeshare \\npartners, industry settlement organisations, and credit provided to direct customers, such as large airline, loyalty and freight \\ncorporate customers. A significant proportion of receivables are settled through the International Air Transport Association (IATA) \\nclearing mechanism which undertakes its own credit review of members The Qantas Group minimises this credit risk through the \\napplication of stringent credit policies and accreditation of travel agents through industry programs \\n–  Other financial asset counterparties: The Qantas Group restricts its dealings to counterparties that have acceptable credit ratings. \\nShould the rating of a counterparty fall below certain levels, internal policy dictates that approval by the Board is required to maintain the \\nlevel of the counterparty exposure. Alternatively, Management may consider closing out positions with the counterparty or novate \\nopen positions to another counterparty with acceptable credit ratings \\nThe Qantas Group minimises the concentration of credit risk by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers and \\ncounterparties in various countries in accordance with Board-approved policy. As at 30 June 2020, the credit risk of the Qantas Group \\nto counterparties in relation to other financial assets, cash and cash equivalents, and other financial liabilities amounted to $3,311 million \\n(2019: $2,125 million).

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is determined by valuing them at the present value of future \\ncontracted cash flows. The fair value of forward foreign exchange and fuel contracts is determined as the unrealised gain/loss at balance \\ndate by reference to market exchange rates and fuel prices. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined as the present value \\nof future contracted cash flows. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at the applicable market yield, having \\nregard to the timing of the cash flows. The fair value of options is determined using standard valuation techniques. Other financial \\nassets and liabilities represent the fair value of investments and derivative financial instruments recognised on the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheet.

Offsetting \\nThe Group enters into contractual arrangements such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement \\nwhere, upon the occurrence of a credit event (such as default), a termination value is calculated and only a single net amount is \\npayable in settlement of all transactions that are capable of offset under the contractual terms. The ISDA agreements do not meet \\nthe criteria for offsetting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and consequently, financial assets and liabilities are recognised gross. \\nThis is because the Group does not have any current legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset \\nis enforceable only on the occurrence of future events. The amounts shown as financial assets and financial liabilities would each have \\nbeen $185 million lower (2019: $119 million lower) in the event of the right to offset being currently enforceable. \\nii.  Hedge Reserve \\nThe effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as a cash flow hedge \\nand the cumulative change in fair value arising from the time value of options are included in the hedge reserve. These options relate \\nentirely to transaction-related hedged items. For further information on accounting for derivative financial instruments as cash flow \\nhedges, refer to Note 37(C). For the year ended 30 June 2020, $122 million (2019: $41 million) is expected to be released to the \\nConsolidated Income Statement within one year and $25 million (2019: $(5) million) after one year. Other financial assets and liabilities \\nrepresent the fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 37(C) for a \\ndefinition of the fair value hierarchy. \\niii.  De-designated Hedging \\nThe Group has applied judgement referencing inputs of the Recovery Plan in assessing whether hedged forecast transactions are still \\nexpected to occur. Given the significant decrease in flying activity in the last quarter of the 2019/20 financial year, which is expected to \\ncontinue into the 2020/21 financial year, $571 million of hedge losses were de-designated and recognised immediately in the Consolidated \\nIncome Statement. The amount recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement includes foreign exchange movements since de-\\ndesignation. Prospective changes in fair value of de-designated hedging will be accounted for through the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nWhere hedging has been closed out with deferred settlement terms, this is reflected in the current and non-current payables balance. \\nAny further decline in forecast flying activity and fuel consumption will result in deferred hedge gains and losses to be de-designated \\nand released to the Consolidated Income Statement when the forecast transaction is no longer probable. \\n(D) HEDGE ACCOUNTING \\n  Change in  Amount \\nValue of the  Change in  Change in  Reclassi- De-\\nHedging  Value of the  Value of the  fied  designated \\nNominal  Carrying Amount  Instrument  Hedged Item  Hedging  Hedge  from the  Cash Flow \\nAmount of  of the Hedging  Used for  used for  Instrument  Ineffective- Cash Flow  hedges \\nHedging  Instrument1,2  Calculating  Calculating  Recognised   ness  Hedge  Reclassi-\\nInstrument  Hedge  Hedge  in Other  Recognis- Reserve to   fied to \\nAssets  Liabilities \\nand Hedged  Ineffective- Ineffective- Comprehen- ed in Profit  Profit or  Profit or \\nItem  Hedge Rates  ness  ness  sive Income  or Loss  Loss  Loss3 \\nAs at  \\n30 June 2020  M  $M  $M  $M  $M  $M  $M  $M  $M  $M \\nCash flow                       \\nhedges \\nAUD fuel costs  17  Barrels  AUD/Barrel  68  (131)  (371)  371  (371)  -  128  (603) \\n(up to 3 years)  59–102 \\nOperational  566  USD  AUD/USD  15  (1)  57  (57)  57  -  57  (3) \\nexpenditure  0.65-0.77 \\n(up to 2 years) \\nRevenue   777  USD  AUD/USD  -  (1,098)  (14)  14  (14)  -  (10)  (1) \\n(up to 7 years)   0.69 \\nCapital  566  USD  AUD/USD  18  (3)  27  (27)  27  -  -  - \\nexpenditure  0.67– 0.74 \\n(up to 2 years) \\nInterest  100  AUD  Fixed   -  (7)  8  (8)  8  -  -  - \\n(up to 2 years)  4.45%–5.99% \\n1.

In addition to the QSP, there are a number of small overseas defined benefit plans. The Qantas Group makes \\ncontributions to defined benefit plans that provide defined benefit amounts for employees upon retirement. Under the plans, employees \\nare entitled to retirement benefits determined, at least in part, by reference to a formula based on years of membership and salary levels.  \\nThe defined benefit plans are legally separated from the Qantas Group. Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment \\ndecisions and plan rules, rests solely with the Trustee of the plan. The Trustee of the QSP is a corporate trustee which has a Board \\ncomprising five company-appointed Directors and five member-elected Directors.  \\nThe QSP’s defined benefit plan exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: \\n–  Investment risk: The investment strategy of the QSP’s defined benefit plan is to progressively de-risk the defined benefit investment \\nportfolio as the plan’s funding position improves over time. If the plan assets underperform expectations, the Group may be required \\nto provide additional funding to the plan \\n–  Interest rate risk: Changes in bond yields, such as a decrease in corporate bond yields, will increase defined benefit liabilities \\nthrough the discount rate assumed \\n–  Inflation risk: The defined benefit liabilities are linked to salary inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.  \\n(A) FUNDING \\nEmployer contributions to the defined benefit plans are based on recommendations by the plans’ actuaries. It is estimated that \\n$79 million of normal employer contributions will be paid by the Qantas Group to its defined benefit plans in 2020/21 (2019/20: \\n$82 million). \\nThe QSP has in place an Additional Funding Plan (AFP), agreed in 2019, which addresses the requirements of APRA Prudential \\nStandards. The determination of Qantas’ additional employer contributions under the AFP is triggered if the quarterly determination of \\nthe Defined Benefit Vested Benefits Index (DB VBI) indicates that the DB VBI has been below 100 per cent for two consecutive \\nquarters, or the value of the DB VBI has fallen from a value in excess of 100 per cent at the previous quarter, to a value that is less \\nthan 96 per cent. The DB VBI is the ratio of the QSP’s assets attributable to the defined benefit liabilities to the total defined benefit \\namount that the QSP would be required to pay if all members were to voluntarily leave the plan on the funding valuation date. \\nAdditional benefit payment top-up contributions may also be payable if after two consecutive quarters, the DB Retrenchment Benefits \\nIndex is less than 100 per cent, the DB VBI is below 105 per cent, and retrenchments occur that place a greater than VBI level of \\nfunding strain on the Plan assets. The last additional contribution required under the AFP was paid by Qantas in December 2016. The \\nQSP’s financial position is monitored by the Trustee each quarter.  \\n(B) MOVEMENT IN NET DEFINED BENEFIT (ASSET)/LIABILITY \\n  Present Value   Fair Value of   Net Defined Benefit  \\nof Obligation  Plan Assets  (Asset)/Liability1 \\n$M  $M  $M \\n  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019 \\nBalance as at 1 July  2,392  2,176  (2,499)  (2,468)  (107)  (292) \\nIncluded in the Consolidated Income Statement             \\nCurrent service cost  127  119  -  -  127  119 \\nPast service cost  -  1  -  -  -  1 \\nInterest expense/(income)  71  88  (72)  (95)  (1)  (7) \\nContributions by plan participants  -  -  (22)  (22)  (22)  (22) \\nLosses on curtailments2  -  3  -  -  -  3 \\nTotal amount included in manpower and staff-related expenditure  198  211  (94)  (117)  104  94 \\nIncluded in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive             \\nIncome \\nReturn on plan assets, excluding interest income  -  -  50  (52)  50  (52) \\nLosses from change in demographic assumptions  37  -  -  -  37  - \\n(Gains)/losses from change in financial assumptions  (43)  216  -  -  (43)  216 \\nExperience losses  14  9  -  -  14  9 \\nExchange differences on foreign plans  1  4  (2)  (4)  (1)  - \\nTotal amount recognised in other comprehensive income  9  229  48  (56)  57  173 \\nContributions by employer  -  -  (82)  (82)  (82)  (82) \\nBenefit payments  (157)  (152)  157  152  -  - \\nAssets distributed/liabilities extinguished on settlements  -  (72)  -  72  -  - \\nBalance as at 30 June  2,442  2,392  (2,470)  (2,499)  (28)  (107) \\n1.

Dividends are paid from the \\nprofit reserves of Qantas Airways Limited, as the parent of the Group. \\n   \\n103 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n33  PARENT ENTITY DISCLOSURES – QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED (CONTINUED) \\n(E) CAPITAL EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS \\nThe capital expenditure commitments held by the parent entity are the same as those held by the Group as disclosed in Note 15(C). \\n(F) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES  \\nThe contingent liabilities held by the parent entity are the same as those held by the Group as disclosed in Note 34. \\n(G) PARENT ENTITY GUARANTEES IN RESPECT OF DEBTS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES \\nThe parent entity has entered into a Deed of Cross Guarantee with the effect that the Company guarantees debts in respect of its \\nsubsidiaries. Further details of the Deed of Cross Guarantee and the subsidiaries subject to the Deed are disclosed in Note 31. \\nThe parent entity related parties in respect to the provision of guarantees are primarily the same as those held by the Group, which are \\ndisclosed in Note 32. \\n(H) INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES  \\nThe parent entity has total interest-bearing liabilities of $7,272 million (2019: $5,906 million), of which $1,253 million (2019: $1,666 \\nmillion) represent secured loans payable to controlled entities. Of the $6,019 million (2019: $4,240 million) payable to other parties, \\n$4,154 million (2019: $2,550 million) represents secured bank loans and other secured loans, with the remaining balance representing \\nunsecured loans.  \\n34  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES \\nDetails of contingent liabilities are set out below. The Directors are of the opinion that provisions are not required with respect to \\nthese matters, as it is not probable that a future outflow of economic benefits will be required or the amount is not capable of reliable \\nmeasurement. \\n(A) GUARANTEES \\nThe Qantas Group co-guarantees the finance lease obligations for two A320 aircraft on behalf of Jetstar Japan to the external lessors \\nin exchange for guarantee fees to the Qantas Group. Subsequent to year end, the Qantas Group in conjunction with other shareholders \\nof Jetstar Japan provided limited guarantees to support unsecured debt raising by Jetstar Japan to increase liquidity in response to \\nCOVID-19. \\nAs part of the business service agreements, the Qantas Group has extended support for the Jetstar-branded airlines in Japan and \\nVietnam by allowing its credit card transactions to be acquired through the Qantas Group’s contractual arrangements. The business \\nservice agreement and credit support with the entity in Vietnam has been terminated subsequent to 30 June 2020. \\nQantas has also entered into guarantees in the normal course of business to secure a self-insurance licence under the Safety, \\nRehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the New South Wales Workers’ Compensation Act, the Victorian Accident Compensation \\nAct and the Queensland Workers’ Compensation Act and Rehabilitation Act, to support non-aircraft lease commitments and other \\narrangements entered into with third parties. Due to specific self-insurance provisions raised, the Directors are of the opinion that the \\nprobability of having to make a payment under these guarantees is remote.  \\n(B) LITIGATION \\nFrom time to time Qantas is subject to claims and litigation during the normal course of business. The Directors have given \\nconsideration to such matters, which are or may be subject to litigation at year end and, subject to specific provisions raised, are of the \\nopinion that no material contingent liability exists. \\n35  POST-BALANCE DATE EVENTS  \\nOn 10 August 2020, the retail Share Purchase Plan was completed, resulting in the issuance of 22.5 million shares at $3.18 per share \\n(totalling $71.7 million). This transaction will be recognised within the 2020/21 financial year. \\nOn 25 August 2020, as part of its COVID-19 Recovery Plan, the Group has informed its employees of initiatives affecting its ground \\nhandling operations at airports across Australia. This is a non-adjusting post-balance date event and has no impact on the financial \\nstatements for the year ended 30 June 2020. \\nSubsequent to year end, the Group completed the debt raising of a 10-year, $0.5 billion unsecured bond issue as part of its ongoing \\nmanagement of its debt maturity profile. The proceeds will strengthen short-term liquidity and be used to pay $0.4 billion in bonds due \\nto expire in June 2021. \\nSubsequent to year end, various Australian state governments reimposed restrictions on interstate travel or imposed expanded \\nlocalised lockdowns. The New South Wales Government introduced restrictions on visitors from Victoria. The Queensland Government \\nreimposed restrictions on visitors from New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory in addition to existing restrictions on \\nvisitors from Victoria. The Victorian Government imposed stage four lockdowns on Greater Melbourne, together with stage three \\nlockdowns on regional Victoria. These government restrictions have impacted demand for domestic travel and the Group has \\nresponded by adjusting capacity. \\nThe Group’s Recovery Plan is a three-year plan, and while these post-balance date events have impacted the timing of demand \\nrecovery, they are expected to have a short-term impact and not materially change the overall assumptions underpinning the Group’s \\nthree-year plan.    \\n104 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements   \\n continued\\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n36  MATERIAL BUSINESS RISKS \\nThe aviation industry is subject to numerous inherent foreseeable risks that can impact operations if left untreated. In rare circumstances \\n‘black swan’ risk events can materialise, resulting in unexpected consequences such as those that the aviation industry is experiencing \\ndue to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Qantas’ operations significantly, including its strategic and financial \\nobjectives.  \\nMaterial business risks arising from COVID-19, notably liquidity risks, are being critically managed to ensure the ongoing sustainability \\nof the Group. To minimise this consequence, Management has established a Three-Year Recovery Plan to rightsize and transform the \\nGroup in response to COVID-19 impacts to guidance the Group’s return to growth. As the impact of COVID-19 evolves, the Group \\ncontinues to plan for a wide range of scenarios and risks. \\nOther inherent risks that can impact the Group’s operations include exposure to changes in economic conditions, changes in government \\nregulations, fuel and foreign exchange volatility and other exogenous events such as aviation incidents, natural disasters, or international \\nconflicts. \\nGeneral economic conditions: As air travel is closely linked with economic growth, the Qantas Group’s operating and financial \\nperformance is influenced by a variety of general economic and business conditions in Australia and overseas. A sustained decline \\nin consumer and business demand as part of a broader deterioration of economic conditions is likely to have a material adverse effect \\non the financial condition and business of the Qantas Group. \\nCOVID-19 has created considerable uncertainty and volatility surrounding these macroeconomic factors, and any further deterioration \\nmay have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Qantas Group. \\nHuman resources and industrial action risk: The Qantas Group operates in a highly regulated employment market and a portion \\nof the Qantas Group’s employees are represented by unions and are party to collective bargaining arrangements. Any significant \\nenterprise bargaining dispute between the Qantas Group and its employees, including in relation to the Recovery Plan, could lead \\nemployees to take industrial action, including work stoppages. This could disrupt the Qantas Group’s day-to-day operations as well as \\nlead to reputational damage. \\nThe COVID-19 crisis has necessitated the standing down of a significant portion of employees. While the need to stand down employees \\nwill decrease over time, any significant successful legal challenge to the Qantas Group’s ability to stand down employees could likely \\nhave a material adverse effect on the Qantas Group’s financial performance and condition. \\nThe Qantas Group also has certain Key Management Personnel whose institutional knowledge, expertise, relationships and experience \\nare considered important to the continued success of the business. The loss of key personnel could adversely impact the Qantas Group’s \\nbusiness and future performance. \\nFurther, given employee costs represent a significant component of the Qantas Group’s operating expenses, increases in labour costs \\n(whether as a result of enterprise agreement negotiations, union action or otherwise) would likely have a material adverse effect on the \\nQantas Group’s financial performance and condition. \\nCustomer risk: The ongoing success of the Qantas Group depends to a large degree on customer satisfaction and loyalty, particularly \\nin light of the significant competition for passengers that characterises the aviation industry. \\nThe significant financial and operational challenges posed by COVID-19, the impact of the pandemic on the travel industry and the \\nresponse of the Qantas Group to these challenges could also impact customer satisfaction and loyalty. In particular, a diminution of \\ncustomer satisfaction due to the cancellation and refund policies of the Qantas Group in the context of COVID-19 may impact the \\nQantas Group’s reputation and its ability to attract customers in the future. \\nIn addition, the Qantas Group is vulnerable to longer-term changes in consumer preferences in relation to its service offerings, the \\nmarkets in which it operates, and consumer sentiment towards leisure travel. Any failure by the Qantas Group to predict or respond \\nto such changes in a timely and cost-effective manner may adversely impact the Qantas Group’s future operating and financial \\nperformance. \\nCompetitive intensity: Ordinarily, the international and domestic aviation markets in which the Qantas Group operates are highly \\ncompetitive, and growth in market capacity ahead of underlying demand impacts profitability on an industry-wide basis. Its competitors \\ninclude many major foreign airlines (including government-owned or controlled airlines), some with more financial resources or lower \\ncost structures than Qantas. This competition may increase with the expansion of existing airlines, the consolidation of existing airlines \\nand/or the creation of alliances between airlines, or new airlines entering the market. \\nAustralia’s aviation policies favour the creation of a more competitive environment, including more liberal rights of entry into Australian \\ndomestic and international markets. These policies have attracted offshore competitors (predominantly state-sponsored airlines) to the \\nAustralian international aviation market, which has further increased competition for passengers on international routes. \\nAdditionally, the Qantas Group ordinarily faces high levels of price competition in the markets in which it operates, which places \\nsignificant pressure on the Qantas Group to price match by offering heavily discounted fares. Aggressive pricing by competitors \\nseeking to gain market share can materially adversely affect the Qantas Group’s revenues and yield performance. The financial impact \\nof any discounting of fares as a result of competitive pressures is exacerbated by the high fixed costs and low profit margins that \\ncharacterise the aviation industry. The combined effect of these factors may have a material adverse effect on the revenue and \\nfinancial condition of the Qantas Group. \\n   \\n105 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n36  MATERIAL BUSINESS RISKS (CONTINUED) \\nReputational and brand risk: The Qantas brand carries significant commercial value and the continued success of the Qantas Group \\nrelies on the maintenance of a positive reputation and brand recognition among customers, suppliers, strategic partners and governments. \\nAny negative publicity (for example, due to a safety incident, labour dispute, regulatory investigation or public customer complaint) may \\ndamage Qantas’ reputation and have a negative impact on its business operations and financial performance. \\nFuel and foreign exchange volatility: The Qantas Group is subject to fuel and foreign exchange risks. These risks are an inherent \\npart of the operations of an airline. The continued focus on forecasting and the operational agility of our aviation operations are supporting \\nthe Group to manage the residual uncertainty. Accordingly, the size of the Group’s fuel and foreign exchange risk will vary in line with \\noperational changes. The Qantas Group manages fuel and foreign exchange risks through a comprehensive hedging program. Qantas \\nwill continue to hedge its fuel and foreign exchange risk in line with this program. In early April, the Qantas Group closed out its over-\\nhedged position through to September 2020, which significantly lowered the exposure to further hedging losses in the short-term. The \\nQantas Group has some fuel hedging arrangements beyond September 2020 in the form of outright options with a base layer of collars. \\nThe collars remain subject to market price movements. There are no margin call obligations on the Qantas Group’s hedging position.  \\nCyber security and data governance: The global cyber and privacy landscape is constantly evolving and at the same time, data \\ngovernance has become an important function for many organisations including the Qantas Group. Qantas remains focused on \\nembedding cyber security, privacy and data governance into business processes, taking a security and privacy by design approach \\nand creating a cybersafe and privacy orientated culture that builds on an established safety culture. The Group is also enhancing its \\nData Governance Framework to ensure ethical and commercial data risks are managed in addition to data protection and privacy. \\nQantas has a defined Risk and Control Framework, aligned with industry standards, which is designed to protect the confidentiality, \\nintegrity, availability and privacy of data and to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The Qantas Group\\'s cyber security \\nand data privacy related controls operate to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber security and data privacy related incidents and \\nrelated impacts. The Group’s cyber and data privacy risks are continuously monitored by the Group Cyber and Privacy Committee and \\nare subject to independent assurance including for material third party suppliers.  \\nKey business partners and alliances: The Qantas Group has relationships with a number of key business partners. In order to continue \\nto maximise mutual benefit from both a financial and customer proposition perspective, governance structures are in place to track and \\nreport performance against common strategic objectives. The Qantas Group continues to proactively build relationships with existing \\nand new industry partners through ongoing dialogue with relevant authorities and stakeholder groups. \\nRisk of increase in airport services related-costs or change in availability of airport facilities: The Qantas Group is exposed to \\nthe risk of increases in airport services-related costs (including air traffic control, airport, transit, take-off and landing fees and security \\ncharges). The availability and cost of airport facilities are fundamental to the ability of the Qantas Group to operate. \\nThese costs represent a significant portion of the Qantas Group’s operating costs and have a financial impact on its operations. Most \\nAustralian airports are privately owned and owners have flexibility to increase charges to airlines. There can be no assurance that \\nmajor airport operators will not continue to increase their fees or that the Qantas Group will not incur new costs in Australia or elsewhere \\n(for example, additional fees assessed against environmental criteria such as emissions levels or noise pollution). Further, it is likely \\nthat security and health measures around the world will continue to be increased in response to the COVID-19 experience and the \\nperceived threat of terrorism, which may lead to increases in airport clearance and security charges. To the extent that the Qantas \\nGroup is unable to pass on any fee increases to its customers, these developments could have a material adverse effect on the Qantas \\nGroup’s operational results and financial position. \\nIn addition, health concerns during the COVID-19 crisis and in the period following it are likely to impact the availability of airport slots \\nand facilities in ways that are difficult to predict. This, too, could have a material adverse effect on the Qantas Group’s operations and \\nRecovery Plan. \\nClimate change: The Qantas Group is subject to short-term and long-term climate-related physical and transition risks. These risks are \\nan inherent part of the operations of an airline and are managed by undertaking scenario analysis, strengthening governance, technology, \\noperational and market-based controls, including proactive consideration of how changing factors (including global climate policies) \\nimpact the proximity of climate-related risks. The Qantas Group has also set ambitious but achievable targets to reduce our emissions \\nby capping emissions at 2020 levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, while also investing in the development of sustainable \\naviation fuels. The Qantas Group is responding to increased demand for transparency on identification and management of climate-\\nrelated risks by aligning our corporate disclosures with the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) including \\nfurther developing and disclosing findings from the scenario analysis first undertaken during the year ending 30 June 2020. These \\ndisclosures are available at https://www.qantas.com/au/en/qantas-group/acting-responsibly/our-planet.html.  \\nAn overview of the Group Risk Management Framework is contained in the Qantas Group Business Practices Document available at \\nwww.qantas.com.au. \\n106 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\n(A)  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  \\ni.  Controlled Entities \\nControlled entities are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to or has rights to, variable returns \\nfrom its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The Financial \\nStatements of controlled entities are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the \\ndate that control ceases. \\nii.  Non-Controlling Interests \\nNon-controlling interests in the results and equity of controlled entities are shown separately in the Consolidated Income Statement, \\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\niii.  Equity Accounted Investments \\nAssociates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating \\npolicies. Significant influence is evidenced through, but not limited to, voting power of the Group, representation on the board of \\ndirectors and participation in policy-making processes. Interests in associates are accounted for under the equity accounting method \\nand initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Consolidated Financial Statements \\ninclude the Group’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, until the date on which \\nsignificant influence ceases. Dividends received or receivable reduce the carrying amount of the equity accounted investment. \\nWhen the Group’s share of total comprehensive losses exceeds the equity accounted carrying value of an associate, the Group’s \\ncarrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has incurred \\nlegal or constructive obligations to fund an associate’s operations or has made payments on behalf of an associate. When an associate \\nis disposed of in its entirety or partially such that significant influence is lost, the cumulative amount in the Foreign Currency Translation \\nReserve related to that associate is reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the \\nGroup disposes of only part of an associate while retaining significant influence, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount in the \\nForeign Currently Translation Reserve related to that associate is reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nThe carrying amount of equity accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in Note 37(G). \\niv.  Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation \\nIntra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between controlled entities are eliminated in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with investments accounted for under the \\nequity method are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate.  \\n(B) FOREIGN CURRENCY \\ni.  Foreign Currency Transactions \\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Group’s companies at the exchange \\nrates at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from \\nthe translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally \\nrecognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the \\nreporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional \\ncurrency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost \\nin a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transactions.  \\nii.   Foreign Operations \\nThe assets and liabilities and the income and expenditure of foreign operations that have a functional currency other than AUD are \\ntranslated into AUD as follows:  \\n–  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet \\n–  income and expenses for each income statement and statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange \\nrates  \\n–  all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the Foreign Currency \\nTranslation Reserve, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to non-controlling interests.  \\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the \\ncumulative amount in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to the Consolidated \\nIncome Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interests in a subsidiary but retains control, \\nthen the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part \\nof an associate or joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is \\nreclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement.  \\n   \\n107 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(C) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\nNon-Derivative Financial Instruments \\ni.  Recognition and Measurement of Non-Derivative Financial Assets \\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through \\nprofit or loss, transaction costs related to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss are expensed. \\nThe Group subsequently classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: \\n–  Those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through the Consolidated Income Statement or the Consolidated Statement \\nof Comprehensive Income) \\n–  Those to be measured at amortised cost. \\nii.  Recognition and Measurement of Non-Derivative Financial Liabilities \\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a non-derivative financial liability at its fair value, less transaction costs.  \\nThe Group subsequently measures non-derivative financial liabilities at amortised cost, with any difference between cost and \\nredemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective \\ninterest rate method.  \\nDerivative Financial Instruments \\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value both initially and on an ongoing basis. The accounting for subsequent \\nchanges in fair value depends on whether the derivative is a designated hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being \\nhedged and the type of hedge relationship designated. The Group designates derivatives as either hedges of the fair value of recognised \\nassets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges), or as hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised \\nassets and liabilities or of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges). At the inception of the transactions, the Qantas \\nGroup documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, including the risk management objective \\nand strategy for undertaking each transaction. The Qantas Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an \\nongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedge transactions have been and will continue to be highly \\neffective. \\nFrom time to time, certain derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, notwithstanding that the derivatives are \\nheld to hedge identified exposures. Any changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument or part of a derivative instrument that do not \\nqualify for hedge accounting are classified as ‘ineffective’ and recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\ni.  Fair Value Hedges \\nChanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the \\nConsolidated Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability or firm commitment \\nattributable to the hedged risk. \\nii.  Cash Flow Hedges \\nWhere a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is \\nrecognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated within Hedge Reserve. Any ineffective portion \\nof changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nThe amount accumulated in equity is retained in the Hedge Reserve and reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement in the \\nsame period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss or the hedged item affects profit or loss. Where \\nthe hedged item is capital in nature, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in the hedge reserve is transferred to the carrying amount \\nof the asset when the asset is recognised. \\nIf the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedging \\ninstrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is de-designated \\nprospectively. As a result, the amount accumulated in the Hedge Reserve is reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement \\nimmediately.  \\niii.  Cost of Hedging \\nThe time value of an option, the forward element of a forward contract and any foreign currency basis spread is excluded from \\nthe designation of a financial instrument and accounted for as a cost of hedging. The fair value changes of these elements are \\nrecognised in Other Comprehensive Income and depending on the nature of the hedged item, will either be transferred to the \\nConsolidated Income Statement in the same period that the underlying transaction affects the Consolidated Income Statement \\nor be capitalised into the initial carrying value of the asset.  \\nIf the forecast transaction being hedged is no longer expected to occur, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, \\nthe hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, the cumulative cost of the hedging \\ninstrument recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is immediately reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement.  \\n   \\n108 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(C) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) \\niv.  Fair Value Calculations \\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The fair \\nvalue of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is estimated using valuation techniques consistent with accepted \\nmarket practice. The Qantas Group uses a variety of methods and input assumptions that are based on market conditions existing \\nat balance date. The different methods of estimating the fair value of these items have been defined in the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements as follows:  \\nLevel 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities \\nLevel 2:   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  \\n(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) \\nLevel 3:   Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) \\nv.  Financial Guarantee Contracts \\nFinancial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured \\nat fair value and subsequently at the higher of:  \\n–  the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under AASB 9 Financial Instruments; and  \\n–  the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the \\nprinciples of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  \\nThe fair value of financial guarantees is determined based on the present value of the difference in cash flows between the contractual \\npayments required under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount \\nthat would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations. Where guarantees in relation to loans or other payables of associates \\nare provided for no compensation, the fair values are accounted for as contributions and recognised as part of the cost of the investment. \\n(D) REVENUE RECOGNITION  \\ni.  Net Passenger and Net Freight Revenue \\nNet passenger revenue primarily arises within the Qantas Domestic, Qantas International and Jetstar Group segments. Net freight \\nrevenue primarily arises within the Qantas International segment except where bellyspace is utilised in Qantas Domestic and the \\nJetstar Group. \\nPassenger, freight revenue, capacity hire and air charter revenue are recognised when the travel or service is provided. Revenue \\nrecognised on travel is net of sales discounts, passenger and freight interline/IATA commission and Goods and Services Tax. Net \\nfreight revenue includes amounts the Group receives as operating lease income in relation to freighters leased to customers. \\nAt the time of expected travel, revenue is also recognised in respect of tickets that are not expected to be used. Unused tickets are \\nrecognised as revenue using estimates based on the terms and conditions of the ticket, experience, historical and expected future \\ntrends. The Group generally does not recognise revenue in respect of unredeemed travel credits due to the extended redemption \\nconditions and in certain circumstances, the ability for the passenger to request a refund.  \\nPassenger travel and freight services are generally paid for in advance of travel and are deferred on the balance sheet as revenue \\nreceived in advance. Travel credits are classified as revenue received in advance where they are available for future flights or in certain \\ncircumstances for refund, if requested. Where customers have made refund claims these are classified as payables, where the balance \\nof refunds is material in aggregate.  \\nWhere the passenger is also a Qantas Frequent Flyer member and earns Qantas Points on travel, the allocation of revenue is on \\na proportional basis using relative stand-alone selling prices and the consideration allocated to Qantas Points is deferred as \\nunrecognised redemption revenue. \\nConsideration received in relation to certain ancillary services relating to passenger travel such as credit card fees and change fees are \\nnot considered to be distinct from the passenger flight. Revenue relating to these ancillary services is deferred until uplift to align with \\nthe related passenger travel. These amounts are included within net passenger revenue.  \\nPassenger recoveries (including fuel surcharge on passenger tickets) are included in net passenger revenue. Freight fuel surcharge \\nis included in net freight revenue. \\nii.  Frequent Flyer Marketing Revenue \\nMarketing revenue associated with the issuance of Qantas Points is recognised within the Qantas Loyalty segment as the service is \\nperformed over time (typically this approximates the timing of the issuance of Qantas Points). Marketing revenue is measured as the \\ndifference between the stand-alone selling price of a Qantas Point and the consideration received, using the residual approach. The \\nstand-alone selling price of a Qantas Point is determined using estimation techniques based on the value of redemption options for which \\nQantas Points could be redeemed and considers the proportion of Qantas Points not expected to be redeemed. The consideration for \\nQantas Points is typically received within normal credit terms following issuance of points. \\nMarketing revenue on inter-segment Qantas Point issuances is eliminated on consolidation.  \\n   \\n109 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(D) REVENUE RECOGNITION (CONTINUED) \\niii.  Frequent Flyer Redemption Revenue \\nThe consideration for issuance of Qantas Points is typically received in advance of redemption and is deferred as unrecognised \\nredemption revenue. Redemption revenue is recognised within the Qantas Loyalty segment when Qantas Points are redeemed.  \\nRedemption revenue is measured based on the weighted average value of the points redeemed. Redemption revenue arising from \\nQantas Group flight redemptions is recognised when the passenger is uplifted and within net passenger revenue on consolidation.  \\nRedemption revenue in relation to products provided by suppliers outside the Group, such as Qantas Store redemptions and other \\ncarrier redemptions is recognised in the income statement net of related costs, where the Group is an agent. For the purposes of \\nsegment reporting, the Qantas Loyalty segment reports these redemptions on a gross basis. Adjustments are made within \\nconsolidation eliminations to present these redemptions on a net basis at a Group level within Other revenue. Obligations for returns or \\nrefunds in relation to redemptions from the Qantas Store are recognised where material.  \\nSignificant changes in Qantas Points expected to expire unredeemed are recognised within other income. The Group uses estimates \\nbased on terms and conditions of the Frequent Flyer program, experience, historical and expected future trends to determine any \\namount recognised.  \\niv.  Other Carrier Commissions and Commissions from Third Parties \\nThe Group considers whether it is a principal or agent in relation to services by considering whether it has a performance obligation to \\nprovide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for services to be provided by a third party, such as another \\ncarrier or a third party. Other carrier commission revenue is included within Other revenue and is generally recognised on uplift by the \\nother carrier. Consideration for other carrier commissions is received within normal credit terms through IATA. Commissions from third \\nparties are typically recognised when the underlying good or service has been transferred to the end-customer. \\nv.  Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract \\nThe incremental cost of obtaining a contract is capitalised and amortised over the expected period of benefits to the Group and the \\npattern those benefits are expected to arise The Group recognises the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when \\nincurred where the amortisation period of the asset that would have been recognised is one year or less.  \\n(E) GOVERNMENT GRANTS \\nGrants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and \\nthe Group expects to comply with the conditions. Note 24 provides further information on how the Group accounts for government grants. \\n(F) TAXES \\ni.  Tax Compliance \\nThe Qantas Group is committed to embedding risk management practices to support the achievement of compliance objectives and \\nfulfil corporate governance obligations. Tax risk management is governed by both the Qantas Group Risk Management Policy and the \\nQantas Group Tax Risk Management Policy, ensuring corporate governance obligations with respect to tax risks are met. The Qantas \\nGroup has paid all taxes that it owes and all tax compliance obligations are up to date. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has advised \\nthat the Qantas Group is a key taxpayer, continuing to have a ‘low’ likelihood of non-compliance. The ATO also acknowledged Qantas’ \\ncontinued commitment to engage cooperatively and transparently to mitigate tax risks, including obtaining tax certainty on key transactions \\nthrough the use of binding Private Rulings and entering into a multi-tax Annual Compliance Arrangement (ACA). \\nTax Treaties:  \\nDue to the operation of income tax treaties and specific rules dealing with airlines, the Qantas Group appropriately reports the majority \\nof its income in Australia, with only a small component being reported in foreign jurisdictions (for the purpose of determining liability to \\ncompany tax).  \\nCurrent Income Tax: \\nCurrent income tax liability is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially \\nenacted at balance date where the Group and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income and any adjustment to tax payable \\nwith respect to previous years.  \\nDeferred Tax: \\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial \\nreporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for: \\n–  Temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit \\n–  Temporary differences relating to investments in controlled entities and associates and jointly controlled entities to the extent that \\nthey will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future \\n–  Taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. \\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences only to the extent \\nthat it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each \\nreporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Such reductions \\nare reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to \\nbe applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Qantas \\nprovides for income tax in both Australia and overseas jurisdictions where a liability exists. \\n   \\n110 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(F) TAXES (CONTINUED) \\nii.  Income Tax \\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement \\nexcept to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in Other Comprehensive Income, in which case it is \\nrecognised in equity or in other comprehensive income. \\niii.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) \\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is not \\nrecoverable from the taxation authority. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset \\nor as part of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable \\nfrom, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as a current asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The GST \\ncomponents of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation \\nauthority are classified as operating cash flows. \\niv.  Tax Consolidation \\nQantas and its Australian wholly-owned controlled entities, trusts and partnerships are part of a tax consolidated group. As a \\nconsequence, all members of the tax consolidated group are taxed as a single entity. \\n(G) IMPAIRMENT \\ni.  Non-Financial Assets \\nThe carrying amounts of non-financial assets such as equity accounted investments, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and \\nintangible assets and other assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. \\nGoodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, \\nor more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. For the purpose of assessing impairment, \\ngoodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows \\n(cash generating units). Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying \\namount may not be recoverable. \\nAssets which primarily generate cash flows as a group, such as aircraft, are typically assessed on a cash generating unit (CGU) basis, \\ninclusive of related infrastructure and intangible assets and compared to net cash inflows for the CGU. Where assets are no longer \\nexpected to contribute to the cash flows of a CGU, they are tested for impairment separately. Identification of an asset’s CGU requires \\nsignificant judgement, as it requires identification of the lowest aggregation of assets that generate largely independent cash inflows. \\nIn Management’s judgement, the lowest aggregation of assets which give rise to CGUs as defined by AASB 136 Impairment of Assets \\nare the Qantas Domestic CGU, Qantas International CGU, Qantas Loyalty CGU, Qantas Freight CGU, Jetstar Asia CGU, Jetstar \\nPacific CGU, Jetstar Japan CGU and the Jetstar Australia/New Zealand CGU. Estimated net cash flows used in determining recoverable \\namounts are discounted to their net present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time \\nvalue of money and the risks specific to the assets or CGU. \\nAn impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or CGU’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The \\nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Non-financial assets other \\nthan goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period. The \\nmaximum amount of any impairment reversal is the lower of: \\n–  the amount necessary to bring the carrying amount of the asset to its recoverable amount (if it is determinable); and \\n–  the amount necessary to restore the assets of the CGU to their pre-impairment carrying amounts less subsequent depreciation or \\namortisation that would have been recognised. \\nii.  Financial Assets \\nThe carrying value of financial assets is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is \\nimpaired. Where necessary, the Group recognises provisions for expected credit loss (ECL) at amortised cost, based on 12-month or \\nlifetime losses depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, including risk of default occurring, since initial \\nrecognition. For significant customers, the Group allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on data that is determined to be \\npredictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to external ratings, audited financial statements, management accounts and cash \\nflow projections and available press information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgment. For other customers, \\nECL is assessed based on credit risk characteristics and the days past due. It is then measured based on actual historical credit loss \\nexperienced over the past years, along with other factors to reflect differences between the economic conditions during the period over \\nwhich the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group\\'s view of macro-economic conditions over the expected \\nlives of the receivables. The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay is credit \\nobligations in full. \\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating \\nECL, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This \\nincludes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group\\'s historical experience and informed credit \\nassessment, including forward-looking information. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, \\nsuch as the debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Group. \\n   \\n111 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(H) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  \\ni.  Recognition and Measurement \\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Items of property, plant \\nand equipment are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of the consideration provided plus incidental costs directly attributable \\nto the acquisition.  \\nCosts to dismantle and remove assets \\nThe cost of acquired assets includes the initial estimate of costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which \\nthey are located, and changes in the measurement of existing liabilities recognised for these costs resulting from changes in the timing \\nor outflow of resources required to settle the obligation or from changes in the discount rate. The unwinding of the discount is treated as \\na finance expense in the Consolidated Income Statement.  \\nGains or losses on cash flow hedges of the purchase of assets \\nThe cost also may include transfers from the hedge reserve of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency \\npurchases of property, plant and equipment in accordance with Note 37(C).  \\nCapitalisation of interest  \\nInterest attributed to progress payments made on account of aircraft and other qualifying assets under construction are capitalised and \\nadded to the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income statement in the year in which they are incurred. \\nii.  Subsequent Expenditure \\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to \\nthe Group. \\niii.  Depreciation \\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all items of property, plant and equipment except for freehold land, which is not \\ndepreciated. The depreciation rates of owned assets are calculated to allocate the cost or valuation of an asset, less any estimated \\nresidual value, over the asset’s estimated useful life to the Qantas Group. Assets are depreciated from the date of acquisition or, \\nwith respect to internally constructed assets, from the time an asset is available for use. The costs of improvements to assets are \\ndepreciated over shorter of the remaining useful life of the asset or the estimated useful life of the improvement.  \\nThe principal asset depreciation periods and estimated residual value percentages applied where material are: \\n  Years  Residual Value (%) \\nBuildings and leasehold improvements  0 – 40  0 \\nPlant and equipment  2.5 – 20  0 \\nPassenger aircraft and engines  2.5 – 25  0 – 10 \\nFreighter aircraft and engines  2.5 – 20  0 – 10 \\nAircraft spare parts  15 – 20  0 – 10 \\nUseful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjusted where appropriate, having regard to commercial and technological \\ndevelopments, the estimated useful life of assets to the Qantas Group and the long-term fleet plan. \\niv.  Maintenance and Overhaul Costs \\nEmbedded Maintenance: \\nAn element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed to its service potential, reflecting the maintenance condition of its engines \\nand airframe. This cost is depreciated over the shorter of the period to the next major inspection event, the remaining life of the asset or \\nthe remaining lease term. \\nSubsequent Maintenance Expenditure: \\nThe costs of subsequent major cyclical maintenance checks for owned and leased aircraft are recognised as an asset and depreciated \\nover the shorter of the scheduled usage period to the next major inspection event, the remaining life of the aircraft or lease term (as \\nappropriate to their estimated residual value). Maintenance checks which are covered by third-party maintenance agreements where \\nthere is a transfer of risk and legal obligation are expensed on the basis of hours flown. All other maintenance costs are expensed as \\nincurred. \\nModifications: \\nModifications that enhance the operating performance or extend the useful lives of aircraft are capitalised and depreciated over the \\nremaining estimated useful life of the asset or remaining lease term (as appropriate to their estimated residual value).  \\nv.  Manufacturers’ Credits \\nThe Qantas Group receives credits from manufacturers in connection with the acquisition of certain aircraft and engines. These \\ncredits are recorded as a reduction to the cost of the related aircraft and engines, when the credits are utilised by the Group.  \\n   \\n112 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(I)  LEASES  \\nThe Group predominantly leases passenger aircraft and engines, freighter aircraft, domestic and international properties, and \\nequipment. Lease contracts are typically entered into for fixed periods but may have extension options. \\ni.  Initial Recognition \\nLeases (other than those described below) are recognised as a lease liability with a corresponding right of use asset at the date at \\nwhich the leased asset is available for use by the Group. \\nScope \\nAASB 16 applies to contracts which convey the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange \\nfor consideration. Control is conveyed where the Group has both the right to direct the use of the identified asset and to obtain \\nsubstantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use. \\nShort-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and that do not contain a purchase option) and \\nleases of low-value assets are not recognised as lease liabilities. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets \\nare recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred. \\nFor contracts that include lease components and non-lease components, these are separated based on their relative stand-alone \\nselling prices. The lease component is recognised as a lease under AASB 16 and the non-lease component is recognised as an \\nexpense in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred. This includes, for example, certain Capacity Hire arrangements where a \\nthird party provides aircraft (lease component) to the Group together with other services such as crew and maintenance (non-lease \\ncomponents). \\nLease liability \\nAt the lease commencement date, lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the lease term. \\nLease payments include fixed payments (less any lease incentives receivable), variable payments that are based on an index or a rate \\n(initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date) and, where relevant, the exercise price of a purchase option \\n(where it is reasonably certain that option will be exercised). \\nThe lease term includes the non-cancellable period for which the Group has contracted to lease the asset, together with any option \\nterms to extend the lease if reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if \\nreasonably certain not to be exercised. When determining the lease term for cancellable leases or renewable leases the Group \\nconsiders both the broader economics of the contract (and not only contractual termination payments) and whether each of the parties \\nhas the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty. Such leases \\ninclude, for example, leases which have expired and are legally cancellable by both the lessor and lessee and/or leases which contain \\nholdover arrangements which allow the lessee to continue to occupy the property beyond the lease end date until the arrangement is \\ncancelled by either the lessee or the lessor. \\nLease payments are discounted using the Group\\'s incremental borrowing rate where the implicit interest rate in the lease is not readily \\ndetermined. The Group\\'s incremental borrowing rate is the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to \\nobtain an asset of similar value or the right to use an asset in an economic environment with similar terms and conditions. \\nRight of use asset \\nAt the lease commencement date, right of use assets are measured at an amount equal to the initial measurement of the lease liability \\n(adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date), and an initial estimate of the present value of restoration \\nor return costs that arise at lease commencement (with the corresponding amount recognised as a provision under AASB 137 Provisions, \\nContingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), less any lease incentives received. \\nii.  Subsequent Measurement \\nLease liability \\nLease payments are allocated between principal and interest payments. The interest expense is recognised in the Consolidated Income \\nStatement over the lease term to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. \\nLease liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Group\\'s functional currency are translated to Australian dollars at each \\nreporting date, however the right of use asset is recognised at the foreign exchange rate at initial recognition. \\nFrom 1 July 2019, in accordance with the Group\\'s Treasury Risk Management Policy, certain foreign currency lease liabilities (for \\nexample, aircraft leases denominated in US dollars) have been designated as a hedging instrument of future corresponding foreign \\ncurrency revenues (for example, US dollar revenues) in a cash flow hedge relationship. The effective portion of the foreign exchange \\nrevaluation of the lease liability is recognised in \\'Other Comprehensive Income\\' and is recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement \\nwithin \\'Net Passenger Revenue\\' when the hedged item is realised. \\nIn accordance with AASB 9, the hedge relationship was designated prospectively from 1 July 2019. For the comparative periods before \\nthis designation (year ended 30 June 2019) the foreign exchange movements on lease liabilities recognised upon adoption of AASB 16 \\nare recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within \\'Other Expenses\\'. \\nThe lease liability is remeasured where there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in index or rate, if there is a \\nchange in the Group\\'s estimate of amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or if there is a change in the lease \\nterm, including the Group’s assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option (reassessed where there \\nis a significant event or change in circumstances that is within the Group\\'s control and affects the ability to exercise, or not to exercise, \\nan option). Where the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is recognised to the right of use asset or is \\nrecorded in the Consolidated Income Statement if the carrying amount of the right of use asset has been reduced to zero. \\nRight of use asset \\nRight of use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset\\'s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. The \\nright of use asset is adjusted for certain changes in the lease liability. \\n113 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(I)  LEASES (CONTINUED) \\niii.  Amendment to AASB 16 \\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to AASB 16 to provide an optional relief to lessees from applying AASB 16’s guidance on \\nlease modification accounting for rent concessions if they are a direct consequence of COVID-19 and meet certain conditions specified \\nin the amendment. The practical expedient allows the lessee to recognise a forgiveness or waiver of lease payments as a variable lease \\npayment in the income statement and a corresponding derecognition of the part of the lease liability that has been extinguished by the \\nforgiveness or waiver of lease payments. The practical expedient also provides guidance on accounting for rent deferrals whereby a \\nchange in lease payment that reduces the payment in one period and proportionally increases the payment in another does not extinguish \\nthe lessee’s lease liability nor changes the consideration for the lease. The lessee would continue to recognise lease payment deferrals \\nwithin the lease liability. \\nThe Group has determined that it meets the conditions to apply the practical expedient and has applied the practical expedient in \\naccounting for rent concessions. The impact of the application of this practical expedient is disclosed in Note 16. \\niv.  Lease revenue \\nLessor accounting under AASB 16 is substantially unchanged from AASB 117. Lessors continue to classify all leases using the same \\nclassification principle as in AASB 117 and distinguish between two types of leases: operating and finance leases. \\nWhere the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the \\nlease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right to use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying \\nasset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease \\nas an operating lease. \\nThe Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term within \\n\\'Net Freight Revenue\\' and \\'Other Revenue and Income\\'. \\n(J) INTANGIBLE ASSETS  \\ni.  Recognition and Measurement \\nGoodwill  Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment \\nlosses. With respect to investments accounted for under the equity method, the carrying amount \\nof goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment. \\nAirport landing slots  Airport landing slots have an indefinite useful life. Airport landing slots are not amortised and are \\nstated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. \\nBrand names and trademarks  Brand names and trademarks have an indefinite useful life and are carried at cost less any \\naccumulated impairment losses.  \\nSoftware  Software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Software \\ndevelopment expenditure, including the cost of materials, direct labour and other direct costs, is \\nonly recognised as an asset when the Qantas Group controls future economic benefits as a result \\nof the costs incurred and it is probable that those future economic benefits will eventuate and the \\ncosts can be measured reliably.  \\nCustomer  Customer contracts/relationships are carried at their fair value at the date of acquisition less \\ncontracts/relationships  accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.  \\nContract intangible assets  Contract intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation \\ncommences when the asset is ready for use.  \\nThe Group considers that there are no individual intangible assets that are material for additional disclosure within the financial \\nstatements.  \\nii.  Subsequent Expenditure \\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which \\nit relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally-generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in the Consolidated \\nIncome Statement as incurred. \\niii.  Amortisation \\nAmortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method \\nover their estimated useful lives and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Goodwill, brand names and trademarks and \\nairport landing slots are indefinite lived intangible assets and are allocated to the relevant CGU. These indefinite lived intangible assets \\nare not amortised but tested annually for impairment. Contract intangible assets are not amortised until such time as the intangible \\nasset is ready for use but are tested annually for impairment.  \\nThe principal amortisation periods and estimated residual value percentages applied where material are: \\n  Years  Residual Value % \\nSoftware  2 – 10 years  0% \\n(K) INVENTORIES \\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost is determined by the weighted average cost method. \\nInventories include mainly engineering expendables, consumable stores and work-in-progress. \\n114 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(L) PAYABLES \\nThese amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the group prior to the end of the financial year which are unpaid. \\nThe amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30-60 days of recognition. Trade and other payables are presented as current \\nliabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at their fair value and \\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, if the effect of discounting is material. \\n(M) PROVISIONS \\nA provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, there is a present legal or constructive obligation that can be measured reliably, \\nand it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are not recognised for future \\noperating losses. \\nIf the effect is material, a provision is determined by discounting the best estimate of the expected future cash flows required to settle \\nthe obligation at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. \\nThe unwinding of the discount is treated as a finance expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nObligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement \\nfor at least 12 months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur. \\nWages, salaries and  Liabilities for wages, salaries and annual leave vesting to employees are recognised in respect of \\nannual leave   employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period. These liabilities are measured at the amounts \\nexpected to be paid when they are settled and include related on-costs, such as workers’ compensation \\ninsurance, superannuation and payroll tax. The annual leave provision is discounted using corporate bond \\nrates which most closely match the expected settlement dates of the provision.  \\nLong service leave  The liability for long service leave is recognised as a provision for employee benefits and measured at the \\npresent value of estimated future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up \\nto the end of the reporting period. The provision is calculated using expected future increases in wage and \\nsalary rates including related on-costs and expected settlement dates based on expected employee \\nusage. The provision is discounted using corporate bond rates which most closely match the expected \\nsettlement dates of the provision. The unwinding of the discount is treated as a finance expense in the \\nConsolidated Income Statement. Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in \\nassumptions are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nRedundancies and  Redundancy provisions are recognised as an expense at the earlier of when the Group can no longer \\nother employee  withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognises costs for a restructuring. These \\nbenefits  benefits are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting period. \\nOther employee benefits such as discretionary bonus amounts due to non-executive employees are \\nrecognised as a provision where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to make the payment to \\nnon-executive employees and the amount can be reliably measured.  \\nOnerous contracts  An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the \\ncontract exceeds the economic benefit expected to be received.  \\nA provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of \\nterminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is \\nestablished, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. \\nMake good on   Aircraft: An initial estimate of the present value of restoration or return costs that arise at lease \\nleased assets  commencement are recognised as a provision with a corresponding amount recognised as part of the \\ninitial recognition of the right of use asset and depreciated over the lease term. Changes in this provision \\nare recognised as an adjustment to the right of use asset. \\nProvisions for return costs that occur over the lease term through usage or the passage of time are \\nrecognised as an expense when they occur. \\nProperty and environment: An initial estimate of the present value of restoration costs that arise at lease \\ncommencement are recognised as a provision with a corresponding amount recognised as part of the \\ninitial recognition of the right of use asset and depreciated over the lease term. Changes in this provision \\nare recognised as an adjustment to the right of use asset. \\nWhere the usage of property or land gives rise to an obligation for rehabilitation, the Group recognises a \\nprovision for the costs associated with restoration. \\nInsurance, legal   Insurance: The Qantas Group self-insures for risks associated with workers’ compensation in certain \\nand other  jurisdictions. Qantas has made a provision for all notified assessed workers’ compensation liabilities, \\ntogether with an estimate of liabilities incurred but not reported, based on an independent actuarial \\nassessment. The provision is discounted using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the \\ntime value of money and the risks specific to the liabilities and which have maturity dates approximating \\nthe terms of Qantas’ obligations. Workers’ compensation for all remaining employees is commercially \\ninsured. \\nLegal and other provisions: These are recognised where they are incurred as a result of a past event, \\nthere is a legal or constructive obligation that can be measured reliably and it is probable that an outflow \\nof economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. \\n \\n   \\n115 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(N) OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS \\nEmployee share plans \\nThe grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with a \\ncorresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect \\nthe number of awards for which related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount \\nultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the \\nvesting date. For share-based payment awards with market performance conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based \\npayment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. \\nThe fair value of equity-based entitlements settled in cash is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in \\nliability over the period during which employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each \\nreporting date and at settlement date based on the fair value. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as an \\nemployee expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nDefined contribution superannuation plans \\nThe Qantas Group contributes to employee defined contribution superannuation plans. Contributions to these plans are recognised as \\nan expense in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred. \\nDefined benefit superannuation plans \\nThe Qantas Group’s net obligation with respect to defined benefit superannuation plans is calculated separately for each plan. The \\nQantas Superannuation Plan has been split based on the divisions which relate to accumulation members and defined benefit members. \\nOnly defined benefit members are included in the Qantas Group’s net obligation calculations. The calculation estimates the amount of \\nfuture benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, which is discounted to determine \\nits present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. \\nThe calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When \\nthe calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available \\nin the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic \\nbenefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. \\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability or asset, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding \\ninterest) and the effect of the asset ceiling are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The Group determines the net \\ninterest expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the \\ndefined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability/(asset), taking into account any \\nchanges in the net defined benefit liability/(asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest \\nexpense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nThe discount rate used is the corporate bond rate which has a maturity date that approximates the expected terms of Qantas’ obligations. \\nChanges in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately \\nin the Consolidated Income Statement as past service costs. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined \\nbenefit plan when the settlement occurs. \\n(O) NET FINANCE COSTS \\nNet finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount \\nrate on lease liabilities, provisions and receivables, interest receivable on funds invested and gains and losses on mark-to-market \\nmovements in fair value hedges. Finance income is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective \\ninterest method. \\nFinance costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred, except where interest costs relate to qualifying \\nassets, in which case they are capitalised to the cost of the assets. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial \\nperiod of time to be made ready for intended use. Where funds are borrowed generally, borrowing costs are capitalised using the \\naverage interest rate applicable to the Qantas Group’s debt facilities. \\n(P) CAPITAL AND RESERVES \\ni.  Ordinary Shares \\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a \\ndeduction from equity, net of tax.  \\nii.  Repurchase of Share Capital \\nWhen share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is \\nrecognised as a deduction from equity. \\niii.  Treasury Shares \\nShares held by the Qantas-sponsored Employee Share Plan Trust are recognised as treasury shares and deducted from equity. \\niv.  Employee Compensation Reserve \\nThe fair value of equity plans granted is recognised in the employee compensation reserve over the vesting period. This reserve will \\nbe reversed against treasury shares when the underlying shares vest and transfer to the employee at the fair value. The difference \\nbetween the fair value at grant date and the cost of treasury shares used is recognised in retained earnings (net of tax).  \\n   \\n116 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(P) CAPITAL AND RESERVES (CONTINUED) \\nv.  Hedge Reserve \\nThe hedge reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments and \\nthe cumulative change in fair value arising from the time value of options related to future forecast transactions. Gains or losses relating \\nto ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nThe amounts within Hedge Reserve reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement in the same period or periods during which the \\nhedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss or the hedged item affects profit or loss. Where the hedged item is capital in nature, the \\ncumulative gain or loss recognised in the hedge reserve is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is \\nrecognised. \\nIf the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedging \\ninstrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is de-designated \\nprospectively. As a result, the amount accumulated in the Hedge Reserve is reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement \\nimmediately.  \\nvi.  Foreign Currency Translation Reserve \\nThe Foreign Currency Translation Reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial \\nStatements of foreign controlled entities and investments accounted for under the equity method. \\nvii. Other Reserves \\nOther reserves includes the defined benefit reserve comprising the remeasurements of the net defined benefit asset/(liability) which \\nare recognised in other comprehensive income in accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits and the fair value reserve comprising \\nthe fair value gains/(losses) on investments at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income.  \\nviii. Dividends \\nA provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Group, \\non or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. Where the Group has revoked a declared \\ndividend, it is no longer recognised as a provision.  \\n(Q) COMPARATIVES \\nThe comparative balances have been restated for the adoption of AASB 16 Leases and the IFRIC agenda decision in relation to the \\ntreatment of fair value hedges of foreign currency risk and non-financial assets (IFRS Fair Value hedging agenda decision). Refer to \\nNote 38 for details of the restatement. \\nWhere applicable, comparative balances have been reclassified to align with current period presentation. A reclassification to \\ndecrease Payables (Current Liability) and increase Revenue Received in Advance (Current Liability) by $99 million has been made \\nin the comparative Consolidated Balance Sheet for the year ended 30 June 2019 to align with current period presentation (June 2018: \\n$81 million).  \\n(R) SEGMENT REPORTING \\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM, being the Chief Executive \\nOfficer, Group Management Committee and the Board of Directors. \\nUnderlying EBIT is the primary reporting measure used by the CODM, for the purpose of assessing the performance of the operating \\nsegments, with the exception of the Corporate segment which is assessed using Underlying PBT. Underlying EBIT of the Qantas Group’s \\noperating segments is prepared and presented on the basis that it reflects the revenue earned and the expenses incurred by each \\noperating segment. The significant accounting policies applied in implementing this basis of preparation are set out below. These \\naccounting policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\nSegment Performance \\nMeasure  Basis of Preparation \\nExternal segment   External segment revenue is reported by operating segments as follows: \\nrevenue  –  Net passenger revenue is reported by the operating segment that operated the relevant flight or \\nprovided the relevant service. For Qantas Airlines, where a multi-sector ticket covering international \\nand domestic travel is sold, the revenue is reported by Qantas International and Qantas Domestic on a \\npro-rata basis using an industry standard allocation process \\n–  Other revenue is reported by the operating segment that earned the revenue. \\nInter-segment   Inter-segment revenue for Qantas Domestic, Qantas International and Jetstar Group operating segments \\nrevenue  primarily represents: \\n–  Net passenger revenue arising from the redemption of Frequent Flyer points for Qantas Group flights \\nby Qantas Loyalty \\n–  Net freight revenue from the utilisation of Qantas Group’s aircraft bellyspace. \\nInter-segment revenue for Qantas Loyalty primarily represents marketing revenue arising from the \\nissuance of Frequent Flyer points to Qantas Domestic, Qantas International and Jetstar Group. Inter-\\nsegment revenue transactions, which are eliminated on consolidation, occur in the ordinary course of \\nbusiness at prices that approximate market prices. The inter-segment arrangements with Qantas Loyalty \\nare not designed to derive a net profit from inter-segment Frequent Flyer point issuances and redemptions. \\n \\n117 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n37  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\n(R) SEGMENT REPORTING (CONTINUED) \\nSegment Performance \\nMeasure  Basis of Preparation \\nShare of net profit/(loss)  Share of net profit/(loss) of investments accounted for under the equity method is reported by the operating \\nof investments  segment that is accountable for the management of the investment. The share of net profit/(loss) of \\naccounted for under the  investments accounted for under the equity method for Qantas Airlines’ investments has been equally \\nequity method  shared between Qantas Domestic and Qantas International. \\nUnderlying EBITDA  The significant expenses impacting Underlying EBITDA are as follows: \\n–  Manpower and staff-related costs are reported by the operating segment that utilises the manpower. \\nWhere manpower supports both Qantas Domestic and Qantas International, costs are reported by \\nusing an appropriate allocation methodology \\n–  Fuel expenditure is reported by the segment that consumes the fuel in its operations \\n–  Aircraft operating variable costs are reported by the segment that incurs these costs \\n–  All other expenditure is reported by the operating segment to which it is directly attributable or, in the case \\nof Qantas Airlines, between Qantas Domestic and Qantas International using an appropriate allocation \\nmethodology. \\nTo apply this accounting policy, where necessary, expenditure is recharged between operating segments \\nas a cost recovery. \\nDepreciation and  Qantas Domestic, Qantas International and Jetstar Group report depreciation expense for passenger and \\namortisation   freight aircraft owned by the Qantas Group and flown by the segment.

The Group adopted AASB 16 from 1 July 2019. AASB 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, \\npresentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for most leases under a single on balance sheet model, similar \\nto the accounting for finance leases under AASB 117. \\nSummary of impact of AASB 16 \\nUnder AASB 16, at the commencement date of a lease, a lessee recognises a liability to make lease payments (i.e. lease liability) and \\nan asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e. right of use asset). \\n–  Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the lease term \\n–  Right of use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability (adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the \\ncommencement date), an initial estimate of restoration or return costs that arise at lease commencement (with the corresponding \\namount recognised as a provision under AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), less any lease \\nincentives received. \\nLessees separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and depreciation expense on the right of use asset. Interest \\nexpense is highest at the beginning of the lease term, decreasing towards the end of the lease term as the lease liability is amortised. \\nPreviously under AASB 117, the Group\\'s leases were classified as either finance or operating leases. Operating leases (primarily \\naircraft and property) were not recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Payments made under operating leases (net of any \\nincentives received from the lessor) were recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of \\nthe lease. \\nThe adoption of AASB 16 did not require any changes to the recognition or measurement of leases previously recognised as finance \\nleases under AASB 117. Leases previously classified as finance lease assets and finance lease liabilities have been transferred to right \\nof use assets and lease liabilities respectively on adoption of AASB 16. \\nUnder AASB 16, within the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, lease payments are split between interest paid (recognised in Operating \\nCash Flows) and repayments of lease liabilities (recognised in Financing Cash Flows). Previously under AASB 117, all lease payments \\nfor operating leases were recognised as an outflow within Operating Cash Flows. Lease payments for finance leases were previously \\nsplit between interest payments and finance lease principal repayments which is unchanged under AASB 16. \\nUnder AASB 16, the initial estimate of the present value of the expected aircraft restoration or return costs that arise at lease \\ncommencement is included within the right of use asset at the inception of the lease with an associated provision. This has resulted \\nin the earlier recognition of lease return provisions, which is reflected in the AASB 16 remeasurements. Provisions for expected \\naircraft restoration or return costs that do not arise at lease commencement continue to be recognised over the lease term. The Group \\nidentifies lease return obligations and estimates the cost of meeting these obligations at the end of the lease term using observable \\ndata and forward-looking judgements. Previously under AASB 117, a provision to meet expected aircraft restoration or return costs \\nwas recognised over the lease term. \\n   \\n118 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n38  NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP (CONTINUED) \\nTransition \\nThe Group adopted AASB 16 using the full retrospective method from 1 July 2019. Under this approach, the Group\\'s lease liabilities, \\nright of use assets and other related balances are measured as if AASB 16 had applied from the lease commencement date of each \\nrelevant lease in place at 1 July 2018. This has resulted in the restatement of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 30 June 2018 and \\n30 June 2019, the Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended 30 June 2019. \\nThe Group elected to use the exemptions proposed by the standard on short-term leases and lease contracts for which the underlying \\nasset is of low value. \\nThe Group\\'s restated Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, \\nConsolidated Cash Flow Statement and Earnings Per Share which reflect the adoption of AASB 16 are presented in Note 38(A) to 38(D). \\nThe Group\\'s revised accounting policies for leases under AASB 16 are provided in Note 37(I). \\nCapital Management \\nThe Group\\'s Financial Framework is outlined in Note 23(C) and is unchanged by the adoption of AASB 16. The Framework includes \\nmaintaining an optimal capital structure that minimises the cost of capital, by holding an appropriate level of net debt. The appropriate \\nlevel of net debt reflects the Qantas Group\\'s size, measured by Invested Capital. This is consistent with investment grade credit metrics. \\nThe adoption of AASB 16 increased both total asset and total liabilities recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet resulting in a \\nchange to the reconciliation between the Consolidated Balance Sheet and net debt under the Group\\'s Financial Framework. \\nNet debt is a non-statutory measure which includes on balance sheet interest-bearing liabilities (which does not include lease liabilities \\nunder AASB 16) and Capitalised Aircraft Lease Liabilities measured under the Group\\'s Financial Framework. \\nCapitalised Aircraft Lease Liabilities are measured at fair value at the lease commencement date and remeasured over the lease term \\non a principal and interest basis. The residual value of the Capitalised Aircraft Lease Liability denominated in a foreign currency is \\ntranslated at a long-term exchange rate.  \\nThis measurement of Capitalised Aircraft Lease Liabilities differs from the lease liability recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet \\nunder AASB 16 which measures lease liabilities as the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Given lease terms are \\nusually shorter than the useful life of an aircraft, the lease liability recognised at lease commencement under AASB 16 (present value of \\nlease payments over the lease term) is generally lower than the Capitalised Aircraft Lease Liability included in net debt under the \\nGroup\\'s Financial Framework (full fair value of the aircraft). \\nThe measurement of net debt under the Group\\'s Financial Framework remains consistent following the adoption of AASB 16 and is \\nreconciled as follows: \\n–  Net debt includes on balance sheet interest-bearing liabilities (which does not include Lease Liabilities) and Capitalised Aircraft \\nLease Liabilities as outlined above \\n–  Non-aircraft leases continue to be treated as a service cost rather than being separated into interest payments and debt repayments \\n(ROIC EBIT is adjusted to account for the full cash expense for non-aircraft leases) \\n–  Upon adoption of AASB 16, finance leases which were previously classified as interest-bearing liabilities have been reclassified to \\nlease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accordingly, Capitalised Aircraft Lease Liabilities under the Group\\'s Financial \\nFramework have been increased to include finance leases, with no net impact to the Group\\'s net debt. \\nThe target net debt range of $4.5 billion to $5.6 billion is based on Invested Capital at 30 June 2020 of $6.0 billion. \\nMetric  June 2020  June 2019 \\n  $B  $B  $B \\nNet debt   4.5 to 5.6  4.7  4.7 \\nIFRIC FAIR VALUE HEDGING AGENDA DECISION \\nIn September 2019, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) published a final agenda decision in relation to the treatment of fair \\nvalue hedges of foreign currency risk on non-financial assets. IFRIC introduced new guidance and requirements in order to hedge \\nexposure to foreign currency risk in the fair value of non-financial assets. \\nThe Group had historically used certain US dollar denominated interest-bearing liabilities as the hedging instrument in fair value hedges \\nof the foreign currency risk of certain non-financial assets (US dollar foreign currency risk in owned aircraft that are recognised as \\nproperty, plant and equipment in Australian dollars). \\nAs a result of the agenda decision and new guidance, the Group is required to retrospectively apply the decision as a change in \\naccounting policy by removing the fair value hedge relationship. This has resulted in the restatement of the Consolidated Balance \\nSheet as at 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2019, the Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the \\nyear ended 30 June 2019. \\nRevised hedge designations \\nFrom 1 July 2019, the Group has applied alternative hedging designations, in line with the Group\\'s risk management framework, which \\nare unaffected by the IFRIC Fair Value hedging agenda decision. \\nThe Group has designated certain US dollar denominated interest-bearing liabilities as a hedging instrument in cash flow hedges \\nof future corresponding foreign currency revenues in a cash flow hedge relationship. The effective portion of the foreign exchange \\nrevaluation of the interest-bearing liability is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and is recycled to the Consolidated Income \\nStatement within Net Passenger Revenue when the hedged item is realised. In accordance with AASB 9, this hedge relationship was \\ndesignated prospectively from 1 July 2019. For the comparative periods before this designation (year ended 30 June 2019) the foreign \\nexchange movements on foreign currency denominated interest-bearing liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Income \\nStatement within Other Expenses. \\n   \\n119 QANTAS ANNUAL REPORT 2020 \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\n continued \\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020 \\n38  NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP (CONTINUED) \\n(A) CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET RESTATEMENT \\nThe impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 30 June 2018 is: \\n  AASB 16 IFRIC 30 June 2018\\n30 June 2018 Remeasurements Fair Value Hedges (restated)\\n$M $M $M $M\\nCURRENT ASSETS \\nCash and cash equivalents  1,694 -

The Directors are responsible for the Other Information.  \\nOur opinion on the Financial Report does not cover the Other Information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any \\nform of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion. \\nIn connection with our audit of the Financial Report, our responsibility is to read the Other Information. In doing so, we consider whether \\nthe Other Information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears \\nto be materially misstated. \\nWe are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information, and based on the work we have \\nperformed on the Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this Auditor’s Report we have nothing to report. \\nResponsibilities of Directors for the Financial Report \\nThe Directors are responsible for: \\n–  preparing the Financial Report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the \\nCorporations Act 2001 \\n–  implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a Financial Report that gives a true and fair view and is free \\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error \\n–  assessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of \\naccounting is appropriate. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern \\nbasis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic \\nalternative but to do so. \\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report \\nOur objective is: \\n–  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to \\nfraud or error; and  \\n–  to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion.  \\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian \\nAuditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. \\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be \\nexpected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Report. \\nA further description of our responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards \\nBoard website at: www.auasb.gov.au/auditors_responsibilities/ar1.pdf.
