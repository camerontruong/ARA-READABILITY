The objective is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that faithfully represents those transactions.\nSCOPE \nIFRS 16 applies to all leases for both the lessee and lessor, except the following exclusions:\nSCOPE EXCLUSION  STANDARD TO APPLY\nLeases to explore for or use materials, oil, natural gas and \nsimilar non-regenerative resourcesNone specified. Depending on the circumstances ‘IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’ or ‘IAS \n38 Intangible assets’ might apply\nLeases of biological assets in scope of IAS 41 held by a lessee IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’\nService concession arrangements in scope of IFRIC 12 IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’\nLicences of intellectual property granted by a lessor in scope of IFRS 15IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’\nRights held under licensing agreements in scope of IAS 38 for \nitems such as motion picture films, video recordings, plays, \nmanuscripts, patent and copyrights\n*IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’\n*for leases of other types of intangible asset a lessee is permitted to apply IFRS 16 but not required to do so' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/factsheet-IFRS16-leases.pdf', 'page': 2}

This refinement was considered necessary as the changes to ‘off-balance sheet’ operating leases for lessee accounting created a greater need for distinguishing a lease from a service contract.\nAASB 16 defines a lease as “a contract, or part of a contract, \nthat conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration”. \nA contract can be (or contain) a lease only if the \nunderlying asset is ‘identified’. Having the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time requires having the right to:\n•  obtain substantially all of the economic benefits \nfrom use of the identified asset; and \n• direct the use of the identified asset;\nthroughout the period of use.\nApplying the new definition therefore involves three key \nevaluations. These are summarised in the flowchart below.\nFlowchart: the three key evaluations\nContract is not  \n(does not contain)  \na lease' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/factsheet-IFRS16-leases.pdf', 'page': 3}
page_content='5 | IFRS 16 Leases\nTHE NEW LESSEE ACCOUNTING \nAPPROACH\nSubject to the optional accounting simplifications \ndiscussed below, a lessee is required to recognise its leases on the balance sheet. This involves recognising: \n• a ‘right-of-use’ asset and \n• a lease liability.\nThe lease liability is initially measured as the present \nvalue of future lease payments. For this purpose, lease payments include fixed, non-cancellable payments for lease elements, amounts due under residual value guarantees, certain types of contingent payments and amounts due during optional periods to the extent that extension is ‘reasonably certain’. The initial measurement of the right-of-use asset is based on the lease liability, with adjustments for any prepaid rents, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred.\nIn subsequent periods, the lease liability is accounted for \nsimilarly to a financial liability using the effective interest method. The right-of-use asset is accounted for similarly to a purchased asset and depreciated or amortised.\nOPTIONAL ACCOUNTING SIMPLIFICATIONS\nIFRS 16 provides important reliefs or exemptions for: \n•  short-term leases (a lease is short-term if it has a lease \nterm of 12 months or less at the commencement date. However, a lease cannot qualify if it contains a purchase option. The use of this exemption is an accounting policy choice that must be made consistently for each class of underlying asset); and \n•  low-value asset leases (the assessment of value is \nbased on the absolute value of each leased asset when new and therefore requires judgement. In the Basis for Conclusions which accompanies the Standard, however, the IASB notes that they had in mind leases of assets with a value when new of around US$5,000 or less. Accordingly, leases of assets such as low value IT equipment, office equipment and furniture would typically qualify, while vehicle leases would not. The use of this exemption is an accounting policy choice that can be made on a lease-by-lease basis). \nIf these exemptions are used, the accounting is similar to operating lease accounting under the current Standard IAS 17 Leases. Lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis (if more representative of the pattern of the lessee’s benefit).PRESENTATION \nIFRS 16 requires lessees to either present right-of-use assets separately from other assets on the balance sheet or disclose separately in the notes. Likewise, lessees are required to either present lease liabilities separately from other liabilities on the balance sheet or disclose separately in the notes. In the income statement, lessees need to show interest expense on the lease liability separately from the depreciation charge for the right-of-use asset. In the statement of cash flows, cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability are presented within financing activities, cash payments for the interest portion are presented either within operating or financing activities (in accordance with IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows). \nLESSOR ACCOUNTING\nIFRS 16’s requirements for lessor accounting are similar to IAS 17’s. In particular: \n•  the distinction between finance and \noperating leases is retained \n•  the definitions of each type of lease, and \nthe supporting indicators of a finance lease, are substantially the same as IAS 17’s \n•  the basic accounting mechanics are also similar, \nbut with some different or more explicit guidance in a few areas. These include variable payments, sub-leases, lease modifications, the treatment of initial direct costs and lessor disclosures.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/factsheet-IFRS16-leases.pdf', 'page': 4}
page_content='6 | IFRS 16 Leases\nDISCLOSURE\nIFRS 16 requires different and more extensive \ndisclosures, both quantitative and qualitative, about leasing activities than IAS 17. The objective of the disclosures is to provide information that enables users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.\nRefer Appendix 1 for a checklist to assist \nwith IFRS 16 disclosure requirements.\nEFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITION\nIFRS 16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16. \nIn terms of transition, IFRS 16 broadly provides \nlessees with a choice between two methods: \n•  full retrospective approach – with restatement \nof comparative information in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. \n•  Cumulative catch-up approach – without \nrestating comparatives. Under this approach the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 is recognised as an adjustment to equity at the date of initial application. If a lessee chooses this method, a number of more specific transition requirements and optional reliefs also apply.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/factsheet-IFRS16-leases.pdf', 'page': 5}
page_content='7 | IFRS 16 Leases\nDEFINITIONS\nFinance lease A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards \nincidental to ownership of an underlying asset. \nInception date of the lease (inception date) The earlier of the date of a lease agreement and the date of commitment by the parties to the principal terms and conditions of the lease. \nInitial direct costs Incremental costs of obtaining a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained, except \nfor such costs incurred by a manufacturer or dealer lessor in \nconnection with a finance lease. \nInterest rate implicit in the lease The rate of interest that causes the present value of (a) the \nlease payments and (b) the unguaranteed residual value to \nequal the sum of (i) the fair value of the underlying asset and (ii) any initial direct costs of the lessor. \nLease A contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to \nuse an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in \nexchange for consideration. \nLease incentives Payments made by a lessor to a lessee associated with a \nlease, or the reimbursement or assumption by a lessor of \ncosts of a lessee. \nLease modification A change in the scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and conditions of \nthe lease (for example, adding or terminating the right to use \none or more underlying assets, or extending or shortening the contractual lease term). \nLease payments Payments made by a lessee to a lessor relating to the right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, comprising the \nfollowing: \na.  fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), \nless any lease incentives; \nb.  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a \nrate; \nc.  the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is \nreasonably certain to exercise that option; and \nd.  payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the \nlease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. \nFor the lessee, lease payments also include amounts \nexpected to be payable by the lessee under residual value \nguarantees. Lease payments do not include payments allocated to non-lease components of a contract, unless \nthe lessee elects to combine non-lease components with a \nlease component and to account for them as a single lease component. \nFor the lessor, lease payments also include any residual value \nguarantees provided to the lessor by the lessee, a party related to the lessee or a third party unrelated to the lessor \nthat is financially capable of discharging the obligations under \nthe guarantee. Lease payments do not include payments allocated to non-lease components.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/factsheet-IFRS16-leases.pdf', 'page': 6}
page_content='8 | IFRS 16 Leases\nLease term The non-cancellable period for which a lessee has the right to \nuse an underlying asset, together with both: \na.  periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the \nlessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and \nb.  periods covered by an option to terminate the lease \nif the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. \nLessee’s incremental borrowing rate The rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds \nnecessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-\nuse asset in a similar economic environment. \nOperating lease A lease that does not transfer substantially all the risks and \nrewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset. \nRight-of-use asset An asset that represents a lessee’s right to use an underlying \nasset for the lease term. \nShort-term lease A lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less. A lease that contains a purchase option is \nnot a short-term lease. \nVariable lease payments The portion of payments made by a lessee to a lessor for the \nright to use an underlying asset during the lease term that \nvaries because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring \nafter the commencement date, other than the passage of time.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/factsheet-IFRS16-leases.pdf', 'page': 7}

page_content='1 \n 1. Introduction  \nThis year marks  the 1 1th anniversary since the European Union  (EU)  mandated International \nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for all companies listed on the main European stock exchanges. \nSince its adoption by the EU , IFRS has had its share of supporters and critics . One of its greatest \nsuccesses has been  its global ad option, with tens of thousand s of firms in over 100 countries  currently  \nreporting under , or at least closely linking their local accounting standards to , IFRS. The greatest \ncriticisms leveled against IFRS have come from practitioners, who have argued against  the fair value \nrequirement s and the transparency and governance structure of the board that issues the standards.1 In \nthis paper , we review the academic literature related to  IFRS adoption, with a primary focus on \nunderstanding  its effects and c onsequences.  \nAlthough the 2005 adoption  of IFRS was a major regulatory transition affecting  several tens \nof thousands of companies worldwide, its costs and benefits were initially  unclear . The debates over \nthe consequences of IFRS adoption at the time were  largely constrained to conjectur al statements  due \nto lack of data  (e.g., Ball 2006; Schipper 200 3). Now, with the hindsight of over 10 years of IFRS \nreporting, we review the academic literature to compile and evaluate the available  empirical evidence \non the effects of  IFRS  adoption . \nThe simultaneous mandatory adoption  of IFRS  by a large number of countries has provided \nempirical researchers with an unprecedented experiment to study the consequences of accounting  \nstandard setting  and how these consequences vary across institutional and legal regimes.  However,  its \neffects on academic research have gone beyond simply  providing a useful context for researchers.  It \nhas also kindled interest in cross -country accounting research and p rovided an opportunity for greater \ninvolvement of researchers from across the globe. Not surprisingly, a vast literature focusing  on IFRS  \nadoption  has emerged . \nIf we had to summarize the development of the IFRS  literature , the majority of early studies  \npaint  IFRS as significant ly benefit ing adopting firms and countries in terms of (i) improved \ntransparency, (ii) lower  costs of capital,  (iii) improved  cross -country investments, (iv) better \ncomparability of fina ncial reports , and (v) increased  following by  foreign analysts. Although  many of \nthese studies include caveats about drawing strong inferences about  the role of IFRS in causing the \nobserved outcomes, these tend to be minimal and often ignored by subsequent research.2 These \nstudies also typically d o not clarify whether the term s “IFRS mandate ” or “IFRS adoption ” refer \nsimply to the act of adopting new standards or include concurrent improvements in the enforcement of \n                                                            \n1 Stojilkovic (2011) and Jarolim and Oppinger (2012)  discuss these criticisms .

More recent studies attempt to narrow down the sources of the  observed benefits of \nIFRS adoption  and conclude that at least some of the earlier documented benefits are not driven by the \nadoption of  new accounting standards per se . Other  recent studies  examining the effects of IFRS on \nthe inclusion of accounting numb ers in formal contracts (which we refer to as the contracting role of \naccounting)  point out that IFRS has lowered the contractibility of accounting numbers .3  \nGiven the rather limited evidence indicating that  IFRS conveys unambiguous  benefi ts to \nadopters  and financial statement users , the widespread  adoption by many countries over a short period \nis somewhat surprising . One possible explanation , identified by Ramanna and Sletten (2014) , is that \nIFRS adoption is self -reinforcing . The perceived benefits , in terms of  lower ing cross -border \ntransaction costs , increase for a given country  as more jurisdictions with economic ties to that  country \nadopt IFRS . Ramanna and Sletten (2014) empirically show that their hypothesis partly explains the \nprevalence of IFRS adoption.  \nA variety of other reviews of IFRS -related research  have been published . Soderstrom and Sun \n(2007) provide an early review of studies focusi ng mainly on  the voluntary adoption of International \nAccounting Standards4 (IAS) or reconciliations between IAS and US generally accepted accounting \nprinciples ( GAAP ). Hail, Leuz , and Wysocki (2010) review  IFRS studies to determine the  \nimplications of US firms potentially switching to IFRS. In particular, they  study the effects of \npotential IFRS adoption by the US on reporting quality , costs, and the capital market . Pope and \nMcLeay (2011) review the empirical IFRS studies emerging from  the INTACCT research program  \nand discuss  implementation  of IFRS  in the EU. Bruggemann, Hitz, and Sellhorn (2013) provide an \noverview of the various IFRS studies without considering the details of individual studies. A review \nby the financial reporting faculty  at the Institute of Chartered Account ants in England and Wales \n(ICAEW) summar izes the empirical literature related to  the effects of mandatory IFRS adoption from \nthe perspective of EU countries ( ICAEW  2015). This review also discuss es the background of IFRS \nlegislation. Ahmed, Chalmers, and Khlif (2013) conduct a meta -analysis of the IFRS literature , \ndrawing  from  a wide range of journals and working papers. However,  their analysis is limited to \nstudies examining the effects of IFRS adoption on value releva nce, discretionary accruals, and analyst \nforecasts.  Their  meta -analysis mainly focuses on  quantify ing the adoption effects documented in prior \nstudies. More recently, Leuz and Wysocki (201 6) review the financial reporting regulation literature, \ndrawing on both US and international evidence. Although  their focus is not on IFRS  per se  but more \n                                                            \n3 Throughout this review, we  distin guish between the contracting and valuation roles of accounting numbers , \nwith the former referring to the use of accounting numbers within formal contracts (such as in debt covenants) \nand the latter referring to the use of accounting numbers for valuation decision s.

In particular, they discuss the \nempirical challenges that researchers face when employing the IFRS setting and highlight the \nlimitations of drawing causal inferences in regulation researc h more generally.  \nIn contrast to the preceding  reviews,  our review is not directed at a specific IFRS -related \nquestion  or issue or restricted to a specific geograph y. It is more comprehensive and provide s a \nrelatively broad coverage of IFRS research  topics . We let the data dictate  our selection of IFRS -\nrelated topics. We cover all of the topics addressed by  IFRS -adoption -related paper s published in the \nfollowing five accounting journals  between 1999 and  2015 : Contemporary Accounting Research , \nJournal of Accounting and Economics , Journal of Accounting Research , Review of Accounting \nStudies , and  The Accounting Review .5 We identify IFRS articles published in these journals by \nsearching for the keywords “International Accounting Standards ,” “IAS ,” or “IFRS” i n each title and \ntext. The topics identified from this process include  the effects of IFRS adoption  on (i) financial \nreporting , (ii) capital market outcomes , (iii) corporate decision -making , (iv) stewardship and \ngovernance , (v) debt contracting , and (vi) auditing. We exclude one study pertaining to taxes due to \nthe limited expertise of authors in that area.6 The review covers  all other papers published in the  five \naforementioned  accounting journals . Although it  also covers  IFRS papers published in other journals, \nits coverage of these other journals  is not intended to be complete.  \nAlthough  our primary focus is on studies based on mandatory adoption, we also review and \nincorporate evidence from early studies of voluntary adoption. In addition, we  link find ings from \nIFRS research to the theoretical and empirical findings reported in other contexts, typically in the US, \nto help readers appreciate the relevance of these studies and to provide insights into how inferences \nvary across contexts.  In addition to pu blished articles, we incorporate several working papers for \ncertain topics  that lack a large body of published works.  \nOur objective is to provide a cohesive picture of  the empirical archival literature related to  \nIFRS adoption . With this in mind, we emphasize similarities and differences across the various \nstudies in terms of not only their findings but also their hypothes is development, methodological \nchoices , and samples.  In synthesizing  the empirical findings, we outline  the theoretical underpinni ngs \nand arguments linking IFRS adoption to the given economic or reporting outcomes  or both . In \naddition, we discuss  studies that focus on specific attributes of IFRS and provide a detailed discussion \nof the research design choices and empirical issues researchers face in the IFRS setting.   \n                                                            \n5 Our search period starts in 1999 , as we find no published papers related to  IAS in these journals before then.  \n6 Chan, Lin, and Mo (2010) examine the effect of IFRS adoption on tax non -compliance.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 4}
page_content='4 \n In terms of structure, we divide the review  into sections based on the topics covered and \nattempt  to ensure that  each section stand s alone as much as possible . People worki ng on specific \nIFRS -related topics should be able to benefit by reading even a limited part of this review.  In line with \nthis approach , each section also typically ends with a summary and suggestions for future research.  \nThe remainder of th is paper is structured  as follows.  The next section  provide s a brief \nhistorical perspective  on IFRS adoption.  It discusses the  objectives and avowed benefits of IFRS \nadoption  as presented around the large -scale adoption in 2005  in addition to the  uncertainties and \nconcerns expressed around that time. Our aim is not to track the chronological development of IFRS \nup to  their eventual global adoption, but rather to provide a context for understand ing the issues \nexamined in the IFRS literature and to evaluate the contribut ions of that literature.7 The studies \ndiscussed in subsequent sections supply empirical evidence relevant to  the debate o ver the benefits \nand limitations of IFRS adoption.  \nSections 3 –9 present the documented effects of IFRS adoption along a variety of dimensions.  \nSection 3 reviews  the studies that examin e the most  direct effect of IFRS  adoption , i.e., their effect on \nfinancial reporting quality. As several studies assume that IFRS improve reporting quality, the \ndiscussion in this section outlines the e mpirical evidence  for this assumption. Section 4 examines \nstudies  that evaluate the stock market effects of IFRS , how IFRS adoption has affected information \nasymmetry in the stock markets , and the attendant consequences such as those on liquidity, cost of \ncapital, analyst following, and cross -border capital flows. Section 5 considers  papers that examine the \nreal effects of IFRS adoption and how corporate decision -making has been influenced by IFRS \nreporting changes. Sections 6 and 7 examine the stewardship and debt -contracting roles of IFRS. \nThese sections review studies that examine how the use of accounting numbers in executive \ncompensation, managerial monitoring , and debt  markets  have  change d with IFRS adoption. Section 8 \nfocuses on studies related to  the auditing issues surround ing IFRS . Section 9 examines  studies that \nfocus on specific accounting attributes of IFRS. Section 10 reviews the empirical choices made by \nvarious studies and conducts  meta -analysis of these choices in the context of IFRS research . Finally, \nwe present our conclusions in Section 1 1. \n \n                                                            \n7 For a  detailed history of the IASC and its evolution into  the IASB, we refer the reader to studies by \nCamffermann and Zeff (2007) and Zeff (2012).' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 5}
page_content='5 \n 2. Background to IFRS adoption  \n2.1. History and development of IFRS  \nThe history of IFRS extends over 40 years . The first set of IAS was issued in 1971 by the \nInternational Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) , which was subsequently restructured to form \nthe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The IASB has globally reshaped the map of \nfinancial reporting  as evidenced by  the large number of countries that have adopted IFRS.  This holds  \ntrue even when one excludes EU adoption , which  provided the initial impetus for broader acceptance \nof IFRS.8 \nIn the EU, most companies with securities traded on regulated markets have been r equired to \nprepare consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS (as endorsed  by the E uropean Commission  \n[EC] ) for financial years starting on or after Jan . 1, 2005.9 However, a  delayed adoption was  allowed \nfor companies that had only debt securities traded publicly.  Several other jurisdictions  such as Hong \nKong and Australia chose to adopt I FRS around the same period with several other s later following \nsuit. \nIFRS introduction seems to have had a substantial effect on the reported financial statements \nof firms. Even in  the UK, where the local GAAP  have been  viewed as similar to IFRS, the financial \nreports of some firms have changed dramatically under IFRS. For insta nce, in its reconciliation of \nprofits under IFRS and UK GAAP, Vodafone disclose d a net profit of £6.5  billion  based on IFRS  for \nfiscal 2005  and a net loss of £6.9  billion under UK GAAP , with the difference largely explained by \ngoodwill amortization  alone . British Airways similarly reported a decline of nearly two -thirds in its \nshareholders ’ equity as a result of having to recognize pension liabilities on the balance sheet  under  \nIFRS . Under UK GAAP, the company disclosed the liabilit ies in its footnotes. These examples show \nhow just one or two accounting items can substantial ly affect a company’s reported profits.10 This \nclearly  indicate s that IFRS adoption has had a major effect  on the financial reports of firms , even in \ncountries whose GAAP and IFRS  are similar . \n2.2. Objective s and rational for IFRS adoption  \nTwo oft -stated objectives of IFRS adoption are to (i) enhance reporting quality and (ii) \nimprove the comparability of ﬁnancial statements across c ountries . This view is enshrined  even in the \nEuropean Parliament’s Regulation 1606/2002, which requir ed the EU to adopt IFRS. The regulation \nstates that IFRS  adoption  is intended to achieve “a high degree of transparency and comparability of \n                                                            \n8 This regulation (Regulation 1606/2002) was adopted by the Council of Ministers of the EU on June  7, 2002.  \n9 This regulation was subsequently enacted into law by the European Parliament on Sept . 11, 2002.  \n10 Barth, Landsman, Young , and Zhuang (2014), who analyze reconciliations of net income across IFRS and \nlocal GAAP, find that  the effect of IFRS on net income tend s to be larger for firms in the UK  than in many other \nEuropean countries.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 6}
page_content='6 \n financial statements and hence an efficient fun ctioning of the (EU) Community capital market and of \nthe Internal Market.”   \nConfirming the se objectives , the IASB states  that the main purpose of its work is: \n… to develop, in the public interest, a single set of high quality, understandable, \nenforceable and globally accepted financial reporting standards based on clearly articulated \nprinciples.   These standards should require high quality, transparent and comparable \ninformation in financial statements and other financial reporting to help investors, other  \nparticipants in the various capital markets of the world and other users of financial \ninformation make economic decisions . \n2.2.1. Enhance reporting quality  \nThe objective of IFRS  to provid e “a single set of high quality” accounting standards is often \nquoted and emphasized by its promoters.  Although  the goal of enhanc ing reporting quality should be \nwelcomed , as it promote s business by ameliorating  information asymmetry issues, translating it into \npractice is  unlikely to be a smooth or straightforward  process . First, this objective is silent as to  what \n“high quality ” means. Dechow, Ge , and Schrand (2010 ) observe that accounting quality is conditional \non the decision relevance  of the financial information and so is better defined in the context of a \nspecific decision model. For instance, although the  liquidation values of assets are important inputs \ninto decision -making by long-term debt holders, the y are less useful for equity investment decisi ons. \nDechow  et al. (2010)  conclude that “there is no measure of earnings quality that is superior to all \ndecision models ,” implying that an objective to prepare a single set of high quality standards for all \nidentified users may not necessarily be achievable. Consistent with this concern, some recent studies \npoint out that the emphasi s of the role of IFRS in valuation  has made accounting numbers less  useful \nfor inclusion in contracts  (e.g., Ball, Li , and Shivakumar 2015) . \nSecond , the development of high quality accounting standard s may not automatically translate \ninto firms providing  high quality financial reports. Reporting quality is determined partly by the \nquality of accounting rules, but it is also affected by  the innate reporting incentives facing managers \nand incentives facing enforcers of the accounting rules, which include auditors, capital market and \nother financial regulators, courts, etc.  There is little reason to expect  that the incentives  and economic \nforce s faced by  managers and regulators of listed companies in a large open economy like the UK are \nthe same as those in a relatively closed  economy like Qatar . In general , managerial reporting \nincentives and accounting enforcement are endogenous to  a country’s economic, legal , and cultural \nenvironment s.  For instance, managers’ reporting incentives are affected by how financial statement \nnumbers are used in contracts , which in turn are likely to  depend on  legal dictates , by cultural values \nsuch as the religious beliefs of and trust between  individuals , and by institutional factors such as \nfirms’ ownership structures  and corporate governance. The enforcement of accounting rules also \ndepend s on the extent to which business transactions are conducted at arm’s length. When companies' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 7}
page_content='7 \n rely frequently  on closed -door dealings that do not require reliance on publicly  available financial \nreports, regulators’ incentives to enforce accounting rules are reduced. The reporting and enforcement \nincentives are also a ffected by g overnments ’ decisions to  tie accounting numbers to tax policies.  \nFox, Hannah, Helliar, and Veneziani  (2013) illustrate  the links between accounting numbers \nand legal, cultural , and institutional factors in relative detail  through a comparison o f Italy and the \nUK, which represent extreme s within Europe along  these dimensions . First, in terms of legal systems, \nItaly is a civil -law country ; its accounting standards are subservient to its Civil Code , and its \naccounting regulations tend to be incorporated into its national laws.  The authors  also observe that \naccounting standards in Italy “are not compulsory but … have an integrative and interpretative \nfunction with respect to the provisions of the law. ” In contrast, financial reporting in common -law \ncountries like the UK tends to be less heavily regulated by statute s, and national laws tend to be less \ndetailed and permit judgment, allowing accounting standards  to play a more prominent role  in UK \nfinancial report ing. Second, in terms of institutional factors and specifically corporate ownership , UK \nfirms rely on capital markets to raise money , and so financial reporting is needed to ensure \ntransparency and market efficiency. However, companies in Italy are often f amily  owned and \nfinanced through banks, making creditors’ needs more dominant in financial statements. Final ly, in \nterms of cultur e, the UK has traditionally relied on accrual accounting as a key concept, while \nprudence has traditionally domina ted in Italy .   \nThe close link between financial reporting and legal , cultural , and institutional factors \nindicates that  the cost-benefit trade -off o f requiring firms to prepare high  quality financial report s is \nnot identical across countries.  Accounting standards that may appear beneficial in the context of an \nopen or developed economy may be less so elsewhere . A glaring example is the emphasis of IFRS on \nfair value accounting, which provides value -relevant information when fair  values are obtai ned from \ndeep  and liquid markets but may permit manipulation in countries where capital markets are illiquid, \nopaque , under regulated or insufficiently representative of the economy (Fiechter and Novotny -Farkas, \n2015 ). \nFinal ly, in more recent mission statements, the IASB emphasize s the transparency  of financial \nreports as part of the objectives of IFRS .11 However, it is unclear whether greater transparency \ntranslates to better quality financial statements , as mandating higher  transparency requirements can \nlead firms to  engage in costly real earnings management , i.e., structure their transactions to hide \ninformation  or achieve specific reporting goals . Although  most empirical evidence suggests that \ntransparency in financial statements is useful  to capital market participants , these studies are silent as \n                                                            \n11 See http://www.ifrs.org/About -us/Pages/IFRS -Foundation -and-IASB.aspx .' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 8}
page_content='8 \n to how much transparency is optimal and whether greater transparency necessarily promotes overall \nefficiency.  \n2.3. Improve  reporting comparability  \nEven without necessarily improving reporting quality, IFRS may prove economically \nbeneficial by merely narrowing cross -country differences  in financial reports and promot ing \ninternational trade . For instance, EU Regulation 1606/2002 states th at: “This Regul ation reinforces \nthe freedom of movement of capital in the internal market and helps to enable Community companies \nto compete on an equal footing for financial resources available in the Community capital markets, as \nwell as in world capital markets. ” Alon g similar lines, emphasizing the need for global accounting \nstandards to make cross -country transactions less costly and more efficient, former SEC Chairman  \nChristopher C ox observes  the following : \nAnd markets are really just aggregations of people, all of whom communicate better \nif they speak the same language. … Breaking down barriers between nations and among \nsocial classes, which commerce does, has advanced the cause of civilization.   That has always \nbeen the idea behind the SEC’s cooperative initiatives  with the International Accounting \nStandards Board, and with the authorities in over one hundred nations that today are using \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards.  (Cox 2014)  \nConfirming these  benefit s of improved comparability, Standard & Poor’s not es that “ [g]lobal \naccounting and disclosure standards will be of great value to our analysts, by improving data \nconsistency and enabling enhanced global peer comparisons .”12 \nHowever, as discussed earlier, financial reporting quality is determined  not only by \naccounting standards but also by a country’s legal system, cultur e, and institution s. As a result , \nresearchers and practitioners have questioned the ability of a common accounting standard, even if \nmandated , to achieve convergence in the quality of repo rted financial statements (e.g., Ball, Kothari , \nand Robin 2000 ; Ball, Robin , and Wu 2003). Ball et al. (2000)  provide empirical support for this \nconcern  by showing that reported accounting numbers in shareholder -model countries reflect \neconomic losses in a timelier  manner than in stakeholder -model countries.   \nEven if IFRS achieve global convergence in the short  term, observers have questioned \nwhether these benefits are sustainable. By adopting IFRS , a country esse ntially allows a foreign entity  \nwith no local accountability  to dictate reporting laws and thereby  control the economic incentives and \nactivities of its people and businesses . Cox (2014) points to this concern as a reason why  a full-scale \nadoption of IFRS is unlikely to occur  in the US . Several major IFRS -adopting economies have \nprotected themselves  from this  concern by requiring a national standard  setter to review and , if \n                                                            \n12 Comment  letter to SEC on allowing US issuers to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS \n(August 7, 2007 ),' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 9}
page_content='9 \n needed, modify IFRS before they become the law of the land.13 This approach to protecting  legislative  \nsovereignty may lead each national regulator to adopt certain standards while rejecting others  and \nover time cause countries to diverge in their accounting standards.14  \nSetting aside the achievability of global standardization , Dye and Sunder (2001)  and Sunder \n(2011)  question whether having a single global set of accounting standards is even desirable. They \npoint to  a variety of benefits to a world that allow s firms to follow either IFRS or US GAAP , \nincluding the opportunity to empir ically evaluate the effects of new accounting standards and to study \nthe pros and cons of principles - and rules -based systems in practice.  They contend that multiple \nreporting regimes would encourage  positive innovations  in financial reporting quality thro ugh the \neffects of competition . \n2.4. Initial fears and uncertainties  about  IFRS adoption  \nThe initial period of IFRS adoption was riddled with uncertainties. Reflecting this concern, \nformer IASB Chairman  Sir David Tweedie  warned : “The first year will always be difficult. It’s the \nbiggest change for Europe since the Euro was introduced. Of course, there are going to be a few blips; \nit’s to be expected.”15  \nThe frequency and speed with which new pronouncements were being introduced a lso \nconcern ed practitioners.  The IASB issued 29 new standards and amendment s to existing standards in \nthe 13  month s between December 2003 and December 2004. In December 2003 alone, the IASB \nissued 15 amendments to IAS.  Moreover, in 2005 , after the firms had started reporting under IFRS, \nabout 10 amendments were  issued.  \nThe “100 Group of finance directors ” and ICAEW critiqued  the IASB approach as \nsubstituting clarity for complexity and complained that standards, particularly  those related  to fair \nvalue reporting, were developing in the wrong direction. There were also complaints that IFRS \nintroduced too much subjectivity and compr omised comparability.16 \nBased on a survey of 149 finance professionals  conducted  in October 2004, KPMG global \ndirector Mark Vaessen noted that uncertainty over the final standards and those that would be  \napplicable in the EU delayed the preparation of many EU companies for IFRS adoption.17 Based on  a \n                                                            \n13 Along these lines, publicly listed companies within the EU must comply only with IFRS endorsed by the \nEuropean Commission (EC) . The EC  is not a national standard setter per se but a transnational EU committee.    \n14 On Nov . 19, 2004, the EC endorsed IAS 39 with the exception of two “carve -outs”: one relating to the Full \nFair Value Option and the other to hedge accounting.  In July 2005, the EU ado pted an amended version of the \nregulation for  the fair value option. Some hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 are still to be endorsed.  \n15 “IASB chairman offers respite in big impact pronouncements ” (http://www. cch.co.uk/ , December 17, 2004) . \n16  See “IFRS under attack ,” Accountancy , Sept . 1, 2005.  \n17 “Publication of the first quantified explanations of the impact of IFRS heralds the start of a very different \nphase in their implementation - communicating the findings ,” Accountancy Live , January 2005.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 10}
page_content='10 \n survey of 60 managers from Australi a’s top 200 corporations  conducted by  Jones and Higgins (2006) , \npreparers felt unprepared for adoption and were skeptical  about the claimed benefits. Survey ed buy- \nand sell -side analysts also expressed doubts about their abilities to distinguish between the effects of \naccounting changes from IFRS adoption and the effects of changes in underlying business \nperformance. The biggest knowledge gaps seemed to involve  the most  effective  reporting issues , with \nnearly two -thirds of the surveyed analysts stating that  they knew little about the new standards for \nmergers and acquisitions ( M&A ) and financial instruments and more than half claiming ignorance as \nto the effects of accounting for share options.18 These  findings  led to concerns that share prices could \nbe negat ively affected or become more volatile after the introduction of IFRS : “IFRS won’t change \nthe underlying performance of a business or cash  flow, but the markets may not see it that way. ”19 \nAuditors also raised concerns around the lack of preparation for  the introduction of IFRS. The \nICAEW  claimed that tardy preparation for IFRS adoption by some firms could cause the m to receive \nqualified audit opinions upon IFRS adoption. The chairman of ICAEW’s  Audit and Assurance \nFaculty, Andrew Ratcliffe, also point ed out that auditors had to be more alert  about the potential for \ngreater earnings management under  IFRS .20 \nIFRS  adoption also left uncertainty in the mind s of investors over surprises  that could emerge \nduring the transition. Peter Elwin, head of accounting and valuation at Cazenove , noted that “one is \nalways slightly concerned about the unknown. ” Morgan Stanley Vice -President Leon Michaelides \nexpressed a similar sentiment.21 These concerns were exacerbated because  only a minority of smaller \nUK companies had provided information about  the effects of IFRS for their firms  as of July 2005 . \nDespite the preceding  concerns, the adoption of IFRS was relatively smooth . A survey of \nabout 200 fund managers conducted by PwC and Ipsos MORI in 2006 reveal ed that nearly 75% of \nrespondents felt that IFRS did not adversely affect their  perceptions of firm value.  In addition, firms ’ \ndisclosures of the effects of IFRS seemed to alleviate transitional surprises.  A review of 1,250 ann ual \nreports of required pre -transition disclosures conducted by the Australian Securities and Investment \nCommission found that “all entities  … had successfully provided the required disclosures of the \nimpacts of AIFRS by explaining the key differences in a ccounting practices they expected under \nAIFRS .” \nHowever, the  smooth transition of IFRS still leaves unanswered the question s of whether \nIFRS adoption brought tangible benefits  and, if so at what cost . These important issues have been \nevaluated  by empirical  research papers, which we discuss as follows . \n                                                            \n18 “Avoid nasty shocks: get to grips with IFRS ,” Accounting , February 2005.  \n19 “IFRS sparks share price fears, ” Accountancy , December 2004.  \n20 “Tardy IFRS prep will lead to audit qualifications ,” Accountancy , September 2004.  \n21 “Investors fear IFRS surprises ,” Accountancy Age, July 2005.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 11}

IFRS and Financial Reporting Quality  \nMany proponents believe  that IFRS reporting is of  a higher quality than previous local GAAP \nand that its adoption  improve s financial transparency, lower s information asymmetr y in capital \nmarkets, promote s cross -border comparability, attract s foreign capital flows , and consequently lower s \nthe cost of capital for firms in adopting countries (e.g., Levitt, 1998; IASB, 2002). Given these oft -\nrepeated benefits, it is of little surprise that  the earliest IFRS  studies typically focus  on evaluating the \nquality of financial reports under IFRS foll owing Europe’s mandatory IFRS adoption.  \nSeveral studies have attempt ed to provide direct evidence of IFRS reporting quality by \nexamining the properties of accounting numbers.  We begin this section by reviewing the evidence \nfrom voluntary adoption s and the n discuss the evidence based on  mandatory adoption.  In a separate \nsubsection , we discuss  the effects  of IFRS adoption on comparability, a  dimension of reporting \nquality  given explicit importance  in the IFRS conceptual framework.  \n \n3.1. Evidence from voluntary IFRS adoption  \nAlthough  large -scale mandatory adoption of IFRS did  not occur until 2005, a handful of \nEuropean countries had allowed firms to voluntarily report under IAS since the early 1990s. Focusing  \non these voluntary adopters, researchers hav e attempted to provide initial insights into the  potential \neconomic consequences of IFRS adoption.  \nBased on  a sample of 80 German industrial firms that voluntarily adopted IAS from 1998 to \n2002, Hung and Subramanyam (2007 ) examine the effects on reported financial statement numbers.  \nThey take advantage of the requirement of IAS-adopting German firms to report financial statements \nunder both local GAAP ( “Handelsgesetzbuch ”) and IAS in the adoption year . Analyz ing the \ndifferences in reported num bers across these accounting standards , they find that total assets and book \nvalue of equity are significantly larger under IAS and that there is more cross -sectional variation in \nbook value and net income under IAS relative to German GAAP.  They also  find that the adoption of \nIAS does not improve value relevance or timeliness of financial statement information. A notable \nfeature of the study is its ability to control for underlying economic activities , as it focus es on data  \nrelated to  the same firm -year acr oss two accounting standards.  As with any evaluation of voluntary \nadoption s, self-selection bias is a concern , although t he study attempts to mitigate this with the \nHeckman procedure.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 12}
page_content='12 \n Bartov, Goldberg , and Kim (2005) compare the value relevance (as a proxy for overall \ninformation related to  quality of earnings) across a sample of 417 German firms that report ed under \nIAS, US GAAP , or local German GAAP (HGB).  In contrast to the findings of Hung and \nSubram anyam (2007), Bartov et al. (2005) find a higher value relevance for German firms reporting \nunder  either  IAS or  US GAAP than under local GAAP.22 As there are significant methodological and \nsample -related  differences across the two studies, it is difficult to pinpoint why they reach different \nconclusions. For instance, Bartov et al. (2005) omit book value of equity from their value relevance \nregressions , which may bias the ir coefficient on earnings (Soders trom and Sun 2007). By focus ing on \nboth pre - and post -adoption data , Bartov et al. (2005) may increase the power  of their tests relative to \nHung and Subramanyam  (2007) , who focus only on reported numbers in the year of adoption.  \nHowever, by comparing fina ncial statements for the same year for the same firms under two different \naccounting standards, Hung and Subramanyam (2007) mi tigate the contamination errors and biases \narising from omitted correlated variables.  \nSwitching from the German setting, Kinnunen , Niskanen , and Kasanen (2000) examine  a \nsample  of 19 Finnish firms reporting under both IAS and local Finnish GAAP  from 1984 to 1991  to \nevaluate how the  informativeness of  IAS numbers varies across  two different sets of investors , i.e.,  \ndome stic and foreign investor s. By comparing  the earnings response coefficients  for stocks that can be \nheld by either domestic or foreign investors with those for restricted stocks (i.e., those that can be held \nby domestic investors only), they find that the informatio n content  of IAS reported numbers is higher \nfor foreign investors . \nFor a sample of 35 Swiss firms, Auer (1996) documents an increase in the variance of \nabnormal returns around earnings announcements for firms switching from local Swiss GAAP to IAS  \nand conc ludes that IAS -compli ant numbers are more informative to Swiss investors . However, these \nresults  and those of Kinnunen, Niskanen , and Kasanen (2000) should be interpreted with caution \ngiven the small sample size s and self-selection issues inherent in voluntary adoption studies.  \nSwitching to US capital markets, Harris and Muller (1999) study  a sample of 31 cross -listed \nforeign firms that voluntarily report ed under IFRS between 1992 and 1996  and reported \nreconciliation s of IAS earnings and book values of  equity based on  US GAAP via Form -20F filings .  \nThe authors examine the  value relevance of the reconciliation items (i.e. , their ability to explain stock \nprices and returns)  and find modest evidence of the value relevance of earnings reconciliation \nadjustments based on  market value and return tests.  In additional  tests, they find mixed evidence as to \nwhich accounting method produces amounts that are more highly associated with market values, i.e. , \n                                                            \n22 Bartov et al. (2005) do not find evidence to suggest that US GAAP are of a higher value relevance than IAS, \nsuggesting that their results are driven by a higher value relevanc e of both US GAAP and IAS over local \nGerman GAAP.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 13}
page_content='13 \n IAS amounts are more highly a ssociated with prices  per share  and US GAAP amounts are more \nhighly associa ted with returns.23 Notably, t he author s document little difference between IAS and US \nGAAP earnings and book value s of equity , reporting average  aggregate  adjustments of just 0.27% and \n0.31% of IAS owners’  equity, respectively.  However, these relative ly small difference s may result in \npart because  firms cross -listing to the US are typically large , have  better information environment s, \nand tend to choose accounting policies that are m ore consistent with US GAAP  (e.g., Ashbaugh and \nOlsson 2002).  \nIn a related study, Chen and Sami (2008) examine short -term trading volume reactions to \ninformation contained in Form 20 -F reconciliation s of IAS to US GAAP.  Based on  a sample of  48 \nnon-US firms cross -listed in the US and reporting under IAS, they find that the magnitude of \nreconciliation adjustments is significantly positively associated with abnormal volume in the two  days \naround the Form 20 -F filing date in both the local and US m arket s. They conclude that reconciliation \nadjustments provide information over and above those contained in IAS reports.  \nOther studies also present country -specific evidence that shows little advantage of moving to \nIAS. Van Tendeloo and Vanstraelen (2005 ) find that German firms that voluntarily apply IAS do not \nexhibit differences in earnings management attributes compared with those applying local German \nGAAP. Daske (2006) find s that the cost of equity capital is not significantly different across German \nfirms adopting either IAS or US GAAP.  \nThe foregoing  studies are based on country -specific settings, which offer  the advantage of \nholding constant institutional factors (e.g. , listing requirements, market microstructure s, and \nenforcement) . However, generali zations of evidence from these studies could be problematic .    \nExpanding beyond country -specific analysis, Barth, Landsman, and Lang (2008) study  a \nmatched sample of 327 IAS adopters  and non -adopters  across 21 countries for 1994  through 2003  to \nexamine whether voluntary IAS reporting is associated with better accounting quality. They define \naccounting quality along  three dimensions : the extent of earnings management,  timely loss \nrecognition , and value relevance. The ir arguments for an increase  in quality stem from the assumption \nthat IAS better reflects  the economic reality  and decreases  managerial  discretion in terms of \naccounting choices and that IAS adoption is accompanied by greater enforcement. Based on \nunivariate analysis, they find littl e difference in accounting quality between adopters and non -adopters \nin the pre -adoption period. However, th e difference turns significant in the post -adoption period, \nindicating that IAS adoption is associated with lower earnings management, more timely l oss \nrecognition, and greater value relevance. Their results support the notion that IAS adoption increases \n                                                            \n23 Venkatachalam (1999) provides a nice discussion of alternative explanations  for and interpretations of the \nmixed results of Harris and Muller (1999).' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 14}
page_content='14 \n accounting quality relative to local GAAP. Although the authors are careful not to attribute their \nfindings solely to changes in accounting standards and interpret  “IAS adoption ” as encompassing all \nrelevant changes to the financial reporting system, including changes in  enforcement , subsequent \nresearch  has often loosely attributed the study’s findings exclusively to change s in accounting \nstandards.  \nChristensen, Lee, Walker , and Zeng (2015) revisit the evidence  provided by  Barth et al. \n(2008) in the context of a single country, i.e., German y, where firms  could voluntarily adopt IFRS \nbetween 1998 and 2005  but have been  required to since 2005. The authors  conjecture that voluntary \nadopters , but not mandatory adopters,  are likely to represent firms that face net benefits from IFRS \nadoption. Replicating the methodol ogy of Barth et al. (2008)  separately for  voluntary and mandatory \nadopters , they find  that the subsample of voluntary adopters exhibit significant ly lower earnings \nmanagement, more timely loss recognition, and greater value relevance , while mandatory adopters  \nexhibit little improvement in accounting quality.  They conclude that “the adoption of IFRS does not \nnecessarily lead to higher quality accounting, at least not when the preparers have no incentives to \nbecome more transparent in their reporting .” Although their evidence speaks to the effects of \nIAS/ IFRS adoption in only one country, it more broadly raises questions about the role of mandatory \nIFRS adoption in improving accounting quality.  \nOverall, research based on large  samples  has document ed that voluntary IFRS adoption leads \nto improved  financial reporting quality. However, these results do not endure when underlying \ninstitutional details and economic activities are held constant, as in  the study by Hung and \nSubramanyam  (2007) . Although  these stud ies attempt to rule out self -selection biases, one should be \naware that the potential for such biases remain s in any voluntary adoption setting . \n3.2. Evidence from mandatory adoption  \nFollowing the mandatory adoption of IFRS in the EU and several other countries, several \nstudies have revisit ed the effect s of IFRS adoption on reporting quality. Based on  a sample of firms \nfrom 20 countries that mandatorily adopted IFRS in 2005, Ahmed, Nee l, and Wang (2013) investigate \nwhether IFRS adoption lowers  income smoothing, decreases  earnings aggressiveness  (measured as \npositive excess accruals and less timely loss re cognition ), and decreases  earnings management to \nmeet/beat targets. Their research design allows them to compare  the reporting quality of IFRS \nadopters to a matched sample of non-adopters, where the matching account s for proxies for country -\nlevel enforcement and firm-level characteristics . Their analyses reveal that mandatory adopters \nexhibit greater income smoothing, greater earnings aggressiveness , and a more delayed recognition of \nlosses  but are not statistically  differ ent from matched non -adopters in their earnings management to \nmeet/bea t targets. These results are particularly driven by firms in countries with relatively strong' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 15}
page_content='15 \n enforcement standards. They conclude that accounting quality in general decrease s after IFRS \nadoption, particularly for adopters in countries with strong enforcem ent regimes.  \nIn contrast  to Ahmed, Neel , and Wang (2013) , Barth, Landsman, Lang, and Williams (2012)  \nfind that  the value relevance of net income and book value of equity following mandatory IFRS \nadoption  increase s under IFRS . However,  Barth et al. (2012) do not primarily study  value relevance ; \nthey focus more on evaluating the comparability of financial reports between IFRS adopters and US \nfirms.  In a related study, Barth, Landsman, Young, and Zhuang (2014) examine whether \nreconciliations of local GAAP num bers to IFRS numbers are value relevant to investors. Based on  a \nsample of 1,201 firms in 15 European countries, they find that reconciliation adjustments for net \nincome and book value of equity are value relevant in the sense that they are cross -sectional ly related \nto stock price s. When  the authors focus on the value relevance of adjustments that specifically relate \nto the application of IAS 39 ( financial instruments) , they find that these amounts are value relevant for \nfinancial firms but not for non-financial s. The authors interpret  this finding as an indicati on that \nfinancial  firm investors consider  fair value measurement s under IAS 39 as more relevant  than \ndomestic GAAP measurements . Notwithstanding the  preceding findings , the extent to which evidence \nof value relevance is helpful in assess ing accounting standards  has been debated  (see Hol thausen and \nWatts , 2001 ; Barth, Beaver , and Landsman , 2001 ). \nChen and Sami (20 13) re-examine investor reactions to information contained in the Form 20 -\nF reconciliation of IFRS to US GAAP  during  the mandatory adoption period (2005 –2006) . Based on  a \nsample of 195 firms  cross -listed in the US  and reporting under IFR S, they continue to find a positive \nassociation between the magnitude of reconciliation adjustments  and abnormal volume in the two  \ndays surrounding  the Form 20 -F filing date , consistent with prior results  of Chen and Sami (2008) . \nHowever, the reaction is only evident for firms with low institutional ownership and first -time IFRS \nadopters.  Their results suggest that 20 -F reconciliations provide useful information to a t least  a subset \nof firms  and that the elimination of these reconciliations may impose an information loss on less \nsophisticated inves tors. \nKim, Li, and Li (2012) examine the st ock market consequences of the SEC’s decision in 2007 \nto eliminate 20 -F reconciliations. Using a treatment sample of 78 foreign cross -listed firms that \nmandatorily report under IFRS and a control sample of 162 cross -listed firms that do not use IFRS, \nthey fail to find empirical evidence to support the claims that eliminating 20 -F reconciliations harms \nthe information environment measured along a variety of dimensions, including market liqui dity, \nprobability of informed trading (PIN), cost of equity, analyst forecasts, institutional ownership , and \nstock price efficiency. They also partition their sample based on the magnitude of absolute differences \nbetween IFRS and US GAAP earnings ( before  the elimination of 20 -F reconciliations) and still find \nno significant effects  on liquidity, PIN , and cost of equity.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 16}
page_content='16 \n Similarly, Chen and Khurana (2015) examine stock market reactions to  SEC announcements \nrelating to the decision to eliminate 20-F reconcili ations for IFRS reporters. This approach allows the \nauthors to estimate the net cost or benefit of eliminating the reconciliations  to investors . They \ndocument a positive stock market reaction for US cross -listed firms that report under IFRS relative to \na benchmark sample of cross -listed non -IFRS and domestic US firms. In additional cross -section \nanalysis, they find that this effect  is positively as sociated with proxies for cost savings and negatively \nassociated with the magnitude of IFRS reconciliation amounts. The authors conclude that the costs of \npreparing and auditing the 20-F reconciliations generally outweigh concerns about information loss \nfrom their elimination.  \nConsistent with the mixed evidence presented by  cross -country studies, country -specific \nstudies also yield contradictory findings related to the  effects of mandatory IFRS adoption  on \nreporting quality . For instance, based on  a sample of 150 German high -tech firms that transitioned to \nIFRS from US GAAP in 2005, Lin, Riccardi, and Wang (2012) find that accounting quality worsen ed \nafter the switch, with IFRS accounting numbers exhibiting more earnings management, less timely \nloss recognit ion, and less value relevance.  Based on  a sample of 297 large non -financial UK firms that \nadopted IFRS mandatorily, Horton and Serafeim (2010) find that  the disclosure of IFRS reconciliation \nadjustments provide s information when the reconciliations are neg ative, suggesting that IFRS allows \nfor the credible communication of bad news . The authors also provide evidence of IFRS adjustments \nhaving incremental value relevance over and above UK GAAP numbers. Based on  a sample of 91 \nFinnish firms, Lantto and Sahlstrom (2009) find that the adoption of IFRS rules  related to  fair value, \nfinancial instruments, leases , and income taxes significantly affects  key financial ratios . Comparing  \nfinancial ratios based on accounting numbers reported under both I FRS and local GAAP in the  \ntransitional year, the authors find that profitability ratios increase d by 9-19%, P/E ratios decrease d by \n11%, and gearing increase d by 2.9%.  These mixed findings in  country -specific studies may partly \nreflect  the differences in local GAAP in place before the IFRS mandate.  \nFocusing  on another aspect of accounting quality, Landsman, Maydew, and Thornock (2012) \nexamine the information content of earnings announcements in countries that mandate IFRS adoption \nrelative to countries that retain domestic accounting standards. The authors measure information \ncontent as either  abnormal return volatility or abnormal trading volume. These measures are \npredicated on the notion that the greater the information,  the greater the revision of  investors’ beliefs, \nleading to a higher return volatility around earnings announcement s. Furthermore , greater information \ncontent increase s the  heterogeneity in  investors ’ response s to earnings news,  leading to increase d \ntradin g around earnings announcement s. Adopting  a difference -in-difference s approach, the authors \ncompare changes in information content for firms from 16 mandatory -IFRS -adopting countries \nagainst those for firms in 11 countries that retained local GAAP. The r esults from their sample of' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 17}
page_content='17 \n 21,703 earnings announcements over the 2002 –2007 period reveal a positive association between \nmandatory adoption and  the information content of earnings announcements, indicating that investors \nview IFRS earnings as being of hig her quality than local GAAP. As the increase s are persistent , the \nauthors conclude  that alternative explanations based on uncertainty around the initial adoption or lack \nof familiarity with IFRS are tenable .24 However, without knowing the identity of the traders inducing \nthe greater trading and return volatility, it is difficult to attribute the observed changes unambiguously \nto improved transparency under IFRS.  For instance, if IFRS leads to greater informed trading (as may \nhappen if IFRS numbers are easier  to manipulate,  as argued by Ahmed et al. [2013 ]), then one would \nalso observe higher volatility and trading around earnings announcements.  \nThe preceding  findings based on stock market effects generally indicate that IFRS better \nmeet s the  needs of stock ma rket participants. However, this evidence is insufficient to attribute the \nstock market effects to the accounting standards alone, as mandatory adoption dates can be \ncontaminated by other events or changes in the reporting incentives of firms. One explanat ion for the \nobserved  change, which may or may not be endogenous to the IFRS  mandate , is the increased \ntendency of firms to provide management forecasts around IFRS adoption , as documented by  Li and \nYang (2015) . If Li and Yang (2015) are correct in suggest ing that  the increased management forecasts \narise from improved earnings quality under IFRS, then the forecasts provide a mechanism through \nwhich IFRS affect stock prices.  However , if managers start to provide additional non -financial \ninformation  along wit h earnings forecasts , then the preceding  results may suffer from contamination  \nbias.25  \nStock market investors are only one set of users of financial statements. As reporting must  be \njudged in the context of a specific user, one should be careful not to extrapolate the preceding  findings \nas indicative of  the unconditional superiority  of IFRS  over domestic GAAP or of IFRS adoption  \nbenefitting the economy as a whole. Moreover, given the greater emphasis of IFRS on the valuation \nrole of financial reports, the stock -market -based findings are to an extent expected for countries where  \nthe local GAAP were developed with users other than stock market investors  in mind, such as in cases \nwhere  the country’s economy is not capital  market intensive . \nLang and Stice -Lawrence (2015)  go beyond the usual analysis of reported financial numbers \nand extend the IFRS  literature to encompass qualitative disclosure s in financial reports.  Based on \ntextual analysis of  87,608 annual reports of firms from 40 countries between 1998 and 2011 , they find \nthat IFRS reports tend to be significantly longer and contain less boilerplate language than non -IFRS \n                                                            \n24 Truong (2012) provides corroborative evidence based on analysis of New Zealand firms. He documents a \nsignificant increase in information content over the 1994 –2009  period , with a marked increase immediately \nfollowing the adoption of IFRS.   \n25 We discuss  the contamination issues associated with mandatory IFRS adoption studies in detail in Section 10.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 18}
page_content='18 \n annual reports. In addition, they find greater comparability between textual disclosures of IFRS \nreports relative to that within non -IFRS annual reports. Based on these  results, they conclude that \nmandatory IFRS adoption has probably  increased the quality of textual disclosures.   \n3.3. Financial reporting quality and comparability  \nComparability is an important characteristic of financial reporting quality.  It is defined as the \nquality of information that enables users to identify and understand similarities and differences \nbetween accounting items (IASB , 2010).  That is , financial reports are considered comparable if \nsimilar economic transactions yield similar accounting items and different economic events result in \ndifferent reported items.  The importance placed on this attribute by standard setters is evident given  \nthe following statement of the  IFRS conceptual framework : “Information about a reporting entity is \nmore useful if it can be compared with similar information about other entities and with similar \ninformation about the same entity for another period or another  date.” The EU regulation  for IFRS  \nadoption (EC No. 1606/2002) also states  comparability across markets as a reason for its adoption . \nAs empirical analysis of comparability is relatively new in the accounting literature, we begin \nby provid ing a general discussion o f the research methods employed  to measure  comparability before  \nreview ing the comparability literature specific to IFRS adoption.  \n3.3.1. Measures of reporting comparability  \nAlthough the term “comparability ” is widely used by practitioners, regulators , and \nresearchers, little effort has gone into estimating  comparability until recently. Comparability can refer \nto the similarity in inputs of a reporting system (i.e. , accounting methods, transaction structures, \nbusiness model), the similarity in recognized accounting numbers (reported earnings or assets and \nliabilities) , or the similarity in reporting structure s and disclosures.  Early studies of comparability \nfocus  on either levels of financial or valuation ratios, such as return s on equity and price -earnings \nratios, or stock market valuation s of accounting data.  For instance, Joos and Lang (1994) evaluate \nhow profitability ratios and value relevance measures vary across France, Germany , and the UK and \nconclude that country -specifi c accounting practices affect accounting -based performance measures.  \nAlthough the authors point out that variation s in economic effects across countries are unlikely to \nexplain their conclusions, their approach to estimating accounting comparability does n ot directly \ncontrol for the differences in economic transactions across  their sample firms.  \nSubsequent studies develop input -based measures of comparability. For instance, Bae, Tan, \nand Welker (2008) construct a cross -country measure of comparability based  on the degree to which \nlocal accounting standards deviate from I AS. This measure has been adopted by several studies, \nparticularly in  the examination of  cross -country differences in  the effects  of IFRS adoption. Based on' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 19}
page_content='19 \n a survey of partners in large acco unting firms in 60 countries (see Nobes 2001), Bae et al. (2008) \nidentify 21 key accounting rules and score the m for each country based on their variation s from I AS. \nBy comparing the 21 country -specific scores  across two countries, they calcula te a country -pair \nmeasure of GAAP difference  equal to  the number of items for which the scores differ across the \ncountries. This measure considers two accounting standards as similar (i.e. , low accounting distance) \nwhen both sets of rules either comply with or deviate  from IAS. Although  this survey -based approach \ncan help  explain the cross -country differences in accounting standards, t here are three specific \ndrawbacks due to  the way it is implemented . First, the survey data examined by  Nobes (2001) are \nbased on accounting standards in place as of Dec. 31, 2001 and ignore any subsequent revisions made \nto local GAAP in the lead -up to IFRS adoption. In addition, the data ignores any country -specific \ncarve -outs or differences in the application of IFRS by n ational regulators. Second, this approach \nassumes that countries whose local GAAP  differ significantly from IAS also differ significantly from \none an other , which may not be true. To overcome the issue presented by an absence of  direct \ncomparison between lo cal GAAP, Yu and Wahid (2014) modify the measure by determining  whether \nthe countries share the same legal origin.  That is, country  pairs whose local GAAP  differ from IAS \nare assumed to also differ from each other only if they do  not share the same legal origin.  Third, the \nmeasure captures differences in standards , which may or may not result in meaningful differences in \nthe actual reported amounts or disclosures.  \nDe Franco, Kothari, and Verdi (2011) provide an output -based measure of comparability that \nhas been heavily adopted  in recent studies. They characterize two firms’ accounting systems as \ncomparable if they produce similar financial statements  for a given set of economic events . Relying \non stock returns as a proxy for the net effects of economic eve nts relevant to  financial reports , the \nauthors  calcula te comparability based on the ability of stock returns to explain contemporaneous \nearnings. In the first step , for each firm  quarter, they  estimate an earnings -returns regression  using \nearnings and stock returns in the previous 16 quarters to obtain  model parameters . In the second step , \nfor each firm  quarter, they calcula te the absolute difference between the earnings predicted using the \nfirm’s own parameters and the earnings predicted using a pe er firm’s parameters. The c omparability \nmeasure for a firm  quarter is the average absolute difference in predicted earnings over the pr evious  \n16 quarters.  \nThe measure used by De Franco et al. (2011) focus es exclusively on earnings  comparability, \nwhich , while important , does not capture all of the dimensions of reporting. Moreover, due to its \nreliance on stock returns as a proxy for economic events, the measure may be  affected by cross -firm \ndifferences in stock liquidity, price efficiency, growth options , the pervasiveness of non -financial \ninformation , and other factors that influence earnings -returns relations. As the  measure adopted by De \nFranco et al. (2011)  relies on  a linear regression of earnings on returns, it may be  affected by' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 20}
page_content='20 \n nonlinearit y in the  earnings -returns relations hip. Nevertheless, this measure takes an important step  \nforward  by focusing  on the outputs of financial reporting systems, which are determined not just by \naccounting rules but also by enforcement and reporting incentives.  \nBarth et al. (2012) modify the measure used by De Franco et al. (2011) in several  ways. First, \nthey reverse the regression equation , and, rather than using stock returns as the only dependent \nvariable in the ir analysis , they alternatively use stock returns , stock prices , or cash flows as dependent \nvariables. Second, they extend the list of explanatory variables to include several accounting items \nsuch as earnings, book value of equity, earnings changes , and a loss dummy. Similar to the approach \nof De Franco  et al. (2011), they calculat e the absolute differences in stock returns (or stock prices or \ncash flows) predicted using IFRS and US  firm parameters. Finally, the y calculate the  comparability \nmeasure by averaging the absolute differences in stock returns, stock prices , and cash flow s. A clear  \nadvantage of this measure is that it does not rely on stock returns as a lone proxy for economic \noutcomes and allows a variety of accounting items to be considered simultaneously for comparability. \nHowever,  this measure continues to rely on  the assumption of a linear relation ship between earnings \nand proxies for economic activities . \nSeeking  to measure earnings comparability for a sample of private firms, Cascino and Gassen \n(2015) develop a reporting comparab ility model based on a model that uses contemporaneous cash \nflows to explain accruals. Following a logic  similar  to that of De Franco et al. (2011), they calculate  \ncomparability as the average absolute difference in predicted accrual values using a firm’s own \nparameters and the fitted values obtained using a peer firm’s parameters. As accruals distinguish \naccounting from mechanical cash counting, this model is more focused  on the key role of accounting \nand can also take advantage of studies that attempt to develop theoretically  motivated accrual models.  \nIn addition, the measure is not affected by  specific aspects of stock market functioning and \ncharacteristics.  \nDisclosure  comparability  receive s the least attention in the literature, partly due to its inheren t \ndifficult y. The few studies addressing  this issue tend to do  so using small samples of hand -collected \nand manually coded data to compare the existence, type , and length of disclosures across different \nreporting regimes. For instance, Ashbaugh and Pincus (2001) construct three measures of the  cross -\ncountry comparability of accounting  standards based on differences in disclosure requirements and \nmeasurement meth ods. Using data from 1993 based on  an international sample of 80  firms  that \nvoluntarily adopted IAS , the authors compare the existence and length of disclosure requirements \nbetween the firms’ local GAAP and IAS.26 They score  the differences in disclosure  requirements for \n                                                            \n26 The eight items are  listed as follows : existence of statement of cash flow, disclosure of accounting policies, \ndisclosure of a chan ge in accounting policies , disclosure of the effect of a chan ge in accounting estimates, \ndisclosure of prior period adjustments, disclosure of post -balance -sheet events, disclosure of related party' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 21}

Finally, the \nauthors combine these two ind ices to create an aggregate measure of reporting comparability \n(IASSET).  Although  these measures attempt to direct ly compare  accounting standards  in terms of  \ntheir disclosure requirements and breadth of accounting choices , the few accounting items for which \ndifferences are analyzed and the subjectivity inherent in scoring the differences limit its appeal .  \nSimilar to the  measure adopted in  Bae et al. ( 2008) , using  IAS as a benchmark to compare accounting \nstandards does not  permit  direct pair-wise comparison s of accounting standards . Moreover,  relative to \nDe Franco et al. (2011) and Barth et al. (2012) , whose  approaches can be applied to  large samples, the \nmanual coding required under this approach limits its applicability to large samples.  It also cannot be \neasily adapted to capture time  variations in  disclosure or accounting standards , which matters \nespecially for countries that have fa ced frequent changes in their accounting regulations.  \nLang and Stice -Lawrence (2015) evaluate the comparability of financial reports for a sample \nof non -US firms using the cosine similarity of words contained in the firms’ annual reports. This \nmeasure compares the relative word frequencies between two annual reports , with a score of 0 \nindicating no overlapping words and a score of 1 indicating identical proportions of words. Although  \nthis approach has the advantage of comparing disclosures  across  a large sample  of firms , its \napplicability is limited to firms that provid e English -language reports, which would  result in  a \nselection bias  in an international setting .  \n3.3.2. IFRS adoption and comparability  \nProponents of IFRS have argued that  globally  mandating a uniform accounting standard \nshould improve financial statement comparability  and allow investors and firms to make better \ninvestment decisions. The argument rests on the notion that greater comparability increases the \ninformation available to decision -makers by allowing them to better understand competitors’ financial \nreports and thereby enhance s information transfers across many firms and across countries . \nIFRS is in fact well placed to improve  comparability due to  its focus on principles rath er than \nrules.  By encouraging managers to prepare financial statements based on the essence of an economic \ntransaction rather than a set of relatively inflexible rules, IFRS can ensur e that managers account for \nlike transactions in a like manner and dissimilar transaction s differently  (Schipper , 2003) . However, \nfor this strength to be realized , strong enforcement is required . Weak enforcement can worsen \ncomparability under principles -based accounting standards , as the flexibility can lead managers to \n                                                                                                                                                                                         \ntransactions , and disclosure of segment information. See Table A1 (p.  438) in a stu dy by  Ashbaugh and Pincus \n(2001) for specific detail s about  their measures.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 22}

As standard setters  observe, \n“permitting alternative accounting methods for the same economic phenomenon diminishes \ncomparability” (IASB 2010).   \nSome researchers  have question ed the ability of IFRS to provide truly comparable financial \nreports based on the argument that reporting quality is not only  determined by accounting standards, \nbut also by firms’ reporting incentives.  In their examination of  reporting quality in four East A sian \ncountries, Ball, Robin, and Wu (2003) find that , although accounting standards in these countries are \ncomparable with those in common -law countries (such as UK GAAP, US GAAP , and IAS), their \nfinancial statements are of a lower quality. They conclude t hat merely changing accounting standards \nin a country would be insufficient to improv e reporting quality.  Corroborative evidence for this view \nis provided by Jayaraman and Verdi (2013), who show that greater economic integration following \nthe introduction of the e uro is associated with increases in accounting comparability within the \nEurozone . Their evidence points to the need for  economic integration across countries  to achieve \nbetter comparability of financial reports.  \nEmpirical s tudies attempt to illuminate the comparability -related  effects of IFRS adoption in \ntwo broad ways : (i) by using direct measures of comparability (e.g. , Barth et al. 2012) or ( ii) by \nexamin ing observable market outcomes of comparability (e.g. , Wang 2014; Brochet, Jagolinzer,  and \nRiedl 2013). The first set of studies is often limited in its ability to draw conclusions about  overall \ncomparability , as empirical proxies for comparability focus only on a specific reporting dimension \n(such as earnings or disclosures). However, it has the advantage of being able to identify the source of \ncomparability. The second set infers changes in comparability based on observed changes in the \ninformation environment but cannot attribute the comparability changes to specific reporting \ndimensions.  \nMotivated by the debate o ver US firms adopting IFRS and the 2007 SEC ruling allowing US \ncross -listed firms to file IFRS -compliant financial statements, Barth et al. (2012)  evaluate the relative \ncomparability of the two accounting regimes  (i.e., IFRS and US GAAP) . Adopting  both a modified \nversion of the measure of comparability used by De Franco et al. (2011) and a measure bas ed on a \ncompari son of  value relevance, Barth et al. (2012 ) document that IFRS adoption is associated with a \nsignificant increase in the comparability of financial statements across IFRS firms and a size -and-\nindustry -matched sample of US firms. Moreover, the comparability across IFRS and US firms is \ngenerally higher when firms adopt IFRS mandatorily, are from c ommon -law countries , or are from \ncountries with high er enforcement. The researchers also find that economic integration arising from \nglobalization has little effect on reporting comparability.  Based on these factors, they conclude that' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 23}
page_content='23 \n mandatory IFRS adopt ion and the international co -ordination of accounting regulation s have \nimproved the global comparability of accounting numbers.  \nSome  studies attempt to directly evaluate changes in cross -country comparability measures \nfollowing IFRS adoption.  Using  the value relevance of earnings and book value of equity to assess the \ncomparability of accounting numbers, Liao, Sellhorn, and Skaife (2012) show that French and \nGerman IFRS earnings and book values are comparably priced in the year after IFRS adoption but \nbecom e less comparable in later years.  While Lang, Maffett, and Owens (2010) provide a difference -\nin-difference s analysis of a sample of IFRS adopters and non -adopters, find ing that adoption  increases  \nco-variation in the earnings of firms from different countri es (measured as  the adjusted  R2 from the \nregressions of a firm’s earnings on a matched peer firm’s earnings)  but decreases earnings \ncomparability , as measured  by De Franco et al. (2011).27 The findings of these two studies do not \nsupport the claim that IFRS adoption enhances the comparability of financial statements . \nThrough a comparative study of the effects of IFRS adoption on earnings comparability \nacross countries that adopted the euro ( “euro adopters ”) and those that di d not ( “non-adopters ”), \nJayaraman and Verdi (2013) investigate whether economic integration complements or substitutes \naccounting harmonization.  Conduct ing difference -in-difference s analysis across 15 countries (11 euro \nadopters and four non-adopters), the y document that IFRS -induced improvements in accounting \ncomparability are around three times large r within euro-adopter countries than in other EU countries.  \nThey conclude that IFRS adoption  is better at improving reporting comparability when the underlying \neconomic environments are similar.  \nCascino and Gassen (2015)  focus on the institutional determinants of the link between IFRS  \nadoption and comparability.  Rather than  using  a simple time-series indicator variable to capture IFRS  \nadoption , they examine whether changes in cross -country information transfers following IFRS \nadoption are associated with the magnitude  of reporting  effects from IFRS  adoption. This slight \nmodification to the research approach reveals only weak evidence of a link between  mandatory IFRS \nadoption and improved reporting comparability.  To test whether a lack of incentives to comply with \naccounting rules explain s the initial marginal results, the  authors  hand -collect accounting \nmeasurement information and disclosure compliance  data from the 2006 financial reports of a sample \nof German and Italian  mandatory adopters. They find that firms that compl y better  with IFRS enjoy \nmore comparability. When they repeat analysis for a broader sample of IFRS -adopting firms and \ncountries usin g instruments to proxy for compliance incentives, they reach the same inference.   \n                                                            \n27 For each firm, Lang et al.

page_content='24 \n Cascino and Gassen (2015) also test the comparability effect of mandatory IFRS adoption \nusing a within -country matched sample of private firms as a control group. As pointed  out by Ball and \nShivakumar (2005), private firms have lower compliance incentives than public firms . This allow s \nresearchers to study the role of compliance while holding the institutional environment faced by the \nfirms constant. Consistent with their ear lier conclusions, Cas cino and Gassen (2015) report that the \ncomparability effect of mandatory IFRS adoption is mainly observed for public firms. They also find \nthat IFRS adoption causes public firms to become less comparable with local  private firms that \ncontinue to report under domestic  GAAP . Overall, the ir results show that , although  cross -country \ncomparability improvements require compliance with standards, within -country reporting \ncomparability is affected by mandating IFRS adoption for some companies ( i.e., listed firms) alone.  \nIn contrast to studies that evaluat e comparability directly, Wang (2014) and Yip and Young \n(2012) study cross -border intra -industry information transfers and draw inferences about the  \ncomparability of financial statement information. These studies are predicated on the notion that a \nfirm’s investors can extract more value -relevant information from a foreign peer ’s report  when the  \ntwo firms employ more comparable  measures in their reports . \nWang (2014) investigates whether a ccounting standard harmonization enhances the \ncomparability of financial information across countries by examining changes in cross -border \ninformation transfers upon IFRS adoption. She uses a pair -wise research design containing 26,349 \nfirm-pair-year obser vations for 4,467 unique firms from 46 countries , covering the period 2001 –2008. \nTo increase  the chances of detecti ng transnational information transfers, she focuses on 575 earnings \nannouncements made by global industry leaders, defined as the three large st firms in each year for \neach of the 30 Fama -French industry groups. For each earnings announcement, she examines the price \nreactions of all other non -announcing firms in the same industry that are domiciled in a country \ndifferent from that of the announc ing firm.28 Consistent with the importance of earnings comparability \nto information transfers, she reports that non -announcing firms react more strongly to the earnings \nannouncements of a global leader when both firms report under IFRS than when they report under \ndifferent accounting standards. Moreover, via difference -in-difference s analysis, she finds that \nmandatory IFRS adopters react more strongly to  the earnings announcements of voluntary adopters in \nthe post -adoption period than in the pre -adoption period and that this effect is not observed for non -\nadopters. Her findings are consistent with mandatory IFRS adoption along with contemporaneous \nregulatory chang es improv ing earnings comparability. However, the larger transnational information \ntransfer between f irms using the same accounting standards is significant only for announcing firms \ndomiciled in countries with stricter enforcement regimes and stronger rep orting incentives, suggesting \n                                                            \n28 To ensure that the transnational information is relevant for a domestic firm, Wang (2014) requires matched \nnon-announcing firms to have foreign sales and to not have announced their own earnings before  the earnings \nannouncements by a global leader.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 25}
page_content='25 \n that the mere adoption of standards is insufficient to improve comparability. Furthermore , consistent \nwith Jayaraman and Verdi (2013), Wang (2014)  finds that these transnational information transfers \nare stronger when the firm -pairs are domiciled in countries with tighter economic integration.  \nIn a concurrent study , Yip and Young (2012) find more nuanced results by expanding the \nmeasures of comparability for  a sample of 2,562 mandatory adopting firms with in 17 EU countries.29 \nThey study both facets of comparability, i.e. , similarit ies in accounting items between  firms engaged \nin similar transactions and differences in accounting items between firms engaged in dissimilar \neconomic activities and implement  three measures of comparability: ( i) similarity in accounting \nfunctions that translate economic events into accounting data (e.g. , De Franco et al., 2011) , (ii) the \ndegree of information transfer, and ( iii) similarity in the information content related to  earnings and \nbook value of equity. For firms in the same industry but domiciled in different countries, the  authors  \ndocument improvements in all three comparability measures following IFRS adoption. However, for \nfirms in different industries and domiciled in different countries, they find that IFRS contributes little \nto the changes in comparability measures.  The authors conclude that IFRS adoption improves the \ncross -country comparability of financial information by making reports of similar firms look more \nalike but does not make reports of firms with different economic activities appear any more \ndissimilar. However, the y note that comparability improvements are primarily observed only in firm -\npairs from countries with the same legal origin (measured as eith er common - or code -law countries) . \nThis is  consistent with the importance of financial reporting incentives and the effectiveness of legal \nenforcement in achieving comparability following IFRS adoption . \nHowever, when  interpreting  the evidence from the preceding  information transfer studies , one \nshould keep in mind that cross -border information transfers  may increase even in the absence of \nimprovements in reporting comparability. To understand this, consider two countries that have very \nsimilar local GAAP that are not oriented to meet the needs of stock -market investors. If one of these \ncountries adopts the more valuation -oriented IFRS, causing financial reports to become more dis -\nsimilar across the two countries, then we would still observe an increase in cr oss-border information \ntransfers, as investors in the second country would react to the increased availability of value -relevant \ninformation. Such cross -border information transfers may be even higher when both countries rather \nthan just one adopt IFRS, although the comparability of financial reports need not necessarily change \nrelative to those based on their respective local GAAP.  \nTo isolate the capital market benefits arising from improvements in comparability (defined as \nthe precision of information tra nsferred across firms) as opposed to improvements in information \nquality (defined as the precision of firm -specific information), Brochet et al. (2013) exploit the UK \n                                                            \n29 Wan g (2014) and Yip and Young (2012) exclude financial firms from their sample s.

They surmise tha t any \ncapital market benefits associated with IFRS adoption in the UK are likely to be due to improvements \nin comparability rather than improvements in firm -specific information quality. The capital market \nbenefits from improved comparability arise through  greater transnational information transfers \nengendered by EU -wide IFRS adoption.  Examining a sample of 663 large and relatively more \nprofitable UK firms, Brochet et al. (2013) find a significant reduction in abnormal returns associated \nwith insider purcha ses in the post -IFRS -adoption period. This finding supports the view that IFRS \nadoption improves reporting comparability for outside investors and thereby lowers the degree of \ninformation asymmetry between insiders and outsiders, limiting the ability of in siders to exploit their \nprivate information. They further support this finding with cross -sectional tests that show that the \ngreatest reductions in profitability of insider trades occur in firms that  experience  larger improvements \nin comparability followin g IFRS adoption. Finally, they report weak evidence of changes in the \nprofitability of insider  trading for stocks listed on the AIM, whose operations tend to be more \ndomestically focused , making transnational information less relevant. Although the ir resul ts support \ntheir predictions , the study is unclear about wh ich types of private information are lost to insiders \nthrough cross -country information transfers that are above and beyond any pre-existing intra-industry \ninformation transfers from domestic  companies.  \nTurning to  the effect of comparability on investors’ decisions, DeFond, Hu, Hung, and Li \n(2011) test whether improve d financial statement comparability  across countries following IFRS \nadoption leads to greater cross -border investment. The ir predictions are based on the notion that \nimproved financial statement comparability decreases the  information acquisition costs of global \ninvestors, thus removing barriers to foreign investment (e.g. , Kang and Stulz 1997; Covrig, DeFond, \nand Hung 2007) .30 However, they note that the cross -border investment benefits of IFRS adoption are \nlikely to be realized only when IFRS is credibly implemented , although they do not discuss which \nenforcement mechanisms lead to that. They empirically test their predictions  for a sample of \nmandatory IFRS adopters in 14 EU countries and firms reporting under domestic GAAP in 10 non -\nadopting countries for the 2003 –2004 and 2006 –2007  periods .31 They find that mandatory IFRS \nadoption results in greater investments by foreign mutual  funds in count ries with strong \nimplementation  credibility and specifically among firms that experience relatively large increases in \naccounting uniformity. Uniformity is measured for each industry in each country as the number of \nfirms in that industry re porting based on the same GAAP after IFRS adoption relative to the number \n                                                            \n30 We discuss these arguments in greater detail in Section 4.3 . \n31 DeFond et al.

These results support the view that harmonization \nthrough IFRS increases demand from foreign investors by improving comparability.32 \nYoung and Zeng (2015) investigate another consequence of improved comparability \nfollowing IFRS adoption for multiples -based valuation. Based on  a sample of firms from 15 EU \ncountries over the 1997 –2011  period , the authors document that multiples -based valuation s using  \nforeign peers’ multiples significantly improve s following the mandatory  adoption of IFRS.33 \nSpecifically, t hey find that  pricing  accuracy  improves  by 2 % per year on average over the sample \n1997 –2008  period . To ensure their results are not driven by the general effects of increased economic \nintegration over the sample period, they partition their sample based on the magnitude of IFRS \nadjustments made to opening shareholders’ equity upon transition. They find that the firms that had \nthe greatest reporting differences relative to IFRS experienced the largest gains in pricing accuracy, \nrelative to the firms that experienced  greater alignment between local reporting practices and IFRS. \nThey conclude  that improved accounting comparability under IFRS has allowed investors to b etter \nvalue stocks through improved  peer selection.  \nIn conclusion, although  studies  focusing  on direct measures of comparability yield  only weak \nevidence, studies focusing  on the capital market effects of comparability generally show a  stronger  \nincrease in comparability following IFRS adoption. Taken together, the empirical results for \ncomparability provide a general picture that comparability matters to investors and that improve ments \nin comparability enhance the information environment, particularly for foreign investors . However,  \nthe data do not support the notion that simply harmonizing accounting standards can achieve full \ncomparability in financial reporting . The e vidence provided by  most studies suggests that reporting \ncomparability is affected by a variety of factors  in addition to  accounting standards, such as reporting \nincentives, underlying economic integration , and institutional factors.  \nIn spite of advances in our under standing of comparability, much remains to be considered .  \nThe research still lacks detailed analysis of why and how accounting comparability arises . Are certain \naccounting attributes more important in achiev ing comparability than others? Do greater managerial \nsubjectivity and accounting choices help or hamper comparability?  Are the documented effects of \ncomparability improvements around IFRS adoption sustainable in the long  run? \n                                                            \n32 Given that IFRS adoption is associated with an increase in the issuance of annual reports in English (Jeanjean, \nStolowy, Erkens, and Yohn 2015), the evidence related to  cross -border capital flow around IFRS adoption may \nalso reflect the benefits of lowering language barriers rather than those of IFRS reporting.  \n33 Young and Zeng (2015) assess the performance of multiples -based valuation using three criteria: pricing \naccuracy (defined as the difference between the actual stock price and valuation implied by foreign peers), the \nability of the implied values to explain cross -sectional varia tions in observed stock prices, and the ability of \nforeign peers ’ valuation multiples to predict firms’ future market -to-book multiples.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 28}

Effects of IFRS on stock market s  \nRegulators and standard setters alike have expressed the view that the adoption of IFRS will \n“reduce the cost of capital and open new opportunities for diversification and improved investment \nreturns” (Tweedie 2006). Proponents have pointed to an increas e in transparency, greater accounting \nquality, and enhanced comparability as paving the way for an increase in liquidity and reductions in \ncost of equity capital. The EC regulation  mandating IFRS (EC 1606/2002) itself cites capital market \nbenefits as a primary reason behind the switch , observing that they  contribut e “to the efficient and \ncost-effective functioning of the capital markets .” \nPrevious theoretical predictions and empirical evidence related to  the link between financial \nreporting quality and capi tal market consequences have been mixed.  In general, these theories find \nthat increasing firms’ commitment to transparency and disclosure can lower information asymmetr y \nin capital markets and thus increase investors’ willingness to trade , thereby boosting  the stock price \n(e.g., Diamond and Verrec chia 1991; Lambert, Leuz , and Verrec chia 2007; Botosan and Plumlee \n2002). Moreover, better quality corporate reporting can reduce estimation risk and improve risk \nsharing in the economy, thus decreasing  firms’ cost  of capital (e.g. , Barry and Brown 1985).   \nIn the context of IFRS adoption, a number of studies attempt to quantify the effect of IFRS \nadoption on stock markets by studying changes in information asymmetry, liquidity, cost of capital, \nvaluation, and cross -border capital flows between the pre - and post -IFRS -adoption periods. These \nstudies are motivated by the conjecture that “principles -based” IFRS improve transparency  as a \nconsequence of  their greater reliance on fair -value accounting , increased disclosures, better cross -\ncountry comparability , and more economically motivated reporting  and that th is improved \ntransparency leads to lower information asymmetry and attendant stock market effects.  Further  \njustifications for the link between  IFRS and improved financial transparency are also often provided \nbased  on initial empirical evidence linking IFRS adoption to improved reporting quality , although as \ndiscussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, recent  studies  provide mixed evidence of this link.  \nFurth ermore , for IFRS adoption to noticeabl y affect capital markets, reporting practices must \nvary significantly from previously established local GAAP.  As some countries’ domestic GAAP are \nmore similar to IFRS than others, researchers exploit this cross -country difference in the effects  of \nIFRS to better link observed stock market effects to IFRS adoption.  \nThe rest of this section is organized as follows.  S ection 4.1 reviews studies that investigat e \ninvestor s’ responses  to IF RS adoption.  Section 4.2 discusses evidence pertaining to the effects of \nIFRS  adoption on analyst following and forecasts .

Investor perception of IFRS  \nArmstrong, Barth, Jagolinzer, and Riedl (2010) provide early  large -sample evidence o f \ninvestor s’ perceptions of IFRS adoption by examining the short -window market reactions surrounding \n16 events  between 2002 and 2005 that increase d the  likelihood of the EU  adopting IFRS to evaluate \nwhether stock  investors  perceived adoption as value enhancing or destroying. Based o n a sample of \nfirms with equity traded on European stock exchanges and therefore affected by the IFRS mandate, \nArmstrong et al. (2010) document an incrementally positive three -day market reaction to events that \nincrease d the likelihood of IFRS adoption , beginning with the decision  of the E U in 2002 to adopt \nIFRS.  \nThe authors find positive market  reactions for analyses based on market -adjusted returns, \nwhere the choice of market  returns  becomes important. The average raw market responses to the \nevents examined are negative. Some of the announcement dates examined in their study have world -\nmarket returns as large in magnitude as −4.4%. A quick review  of Dow Jones News Wire for the \nreason s behind the large dro ps in a few IFRS  announcement dates reveals that some announcement \ndates were affected by contaminated events, such as world markets being  rocked by profit warnings \nfrom  the US tech sector  on Jun e 19, 2002 , and February 3, 2004 . To the extent that contaminated \nevents affect the DJ Stoxx 1800 (excluding Europe) index more than European stocks, market -\nadjusted returns for Europe (measured as European stock returns adjusted for returns on the DJ Stoxx \n1800 excluding Europe)  may be noisy.  \nTo better link European stock market reactions to IFRS news , Armstrong et al . (2010) \nconduct  a cross -sectional analysis of announcement returns  on firm -specific characteristics and find \nthat the positive market reactions are larger for firms  that are mo re likely to benefit from adoption, \nsuch as those  with lower information quality and higher information asymmetry. The positive stock \nprice reaction is also observed for firms with high quality information in the pre -adoption period, \nsuggesting  that IFRS benefits are not simply associated with improving firms’ reporting quality but \nare at least partly attributable to the benefits from accounting standard  harmonization . Finally, \nconsistent with investor s’ concerns over the enforcement of IFRS , the authors  find an incrementally \nnegative reaction for firms domiciled in code -law countries (i.e. , less investor protection).  Although  \nfocusing on a narrow ( three -day) event window mitigates the effects of confounding events that occur \noutside the IFRS  announcement window,  it still leaves open the possibility that investors’ responses to  \nthe anticipated change s in enforcement and regulation accompany the passage of IFRS adoption.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 30}
page_content='30 \n Although  the US has not adopted IFRS reporting, a few studies evaluate th e potential benefits \nof IFRS adoption from the perspective of US investors.  Joos and Leung (2013) study the market \nreaction s to 13 events between 2007 and 2012 pertaining to the SEC’s contemplation of mandatory \nIFRS adoption for US firms.  They find that in vestors’ reaction s to announcements that increas e the \nlikelihood of IFRS adoption are more positive for firms that are likely to benefit from convergence \nbut less so for firms with a higher litigation risk . Prather -Kinsey and Tanyi (2014) use a similar \nsetting but focus on the price reactions of firms with American deposit ary receipts (ADR) that report \nunder IFRS. They also observe a positive market reaction to SEC announcements pertaining to \npotential IFRS a doption for these ADR firms.  \n4.2. Effects of  IFRS adoption on analyst following and forecast properties  \nAlthough they do not focus primarily on IFRS adoption, Bae, Tan , and Welker (2008) provide \nevidence that is directly relevant to understanding the effects of IFRS on analyst following and \nforecast properties. The authors  explore whether GAAP differences across countries are associated \nwith the number of foreign analyst s following the firm s and their forecast accuracy.34 Their sample \nconsists of 6, 888 foreign analysts covering 6,169 firms from 49 differen t countries (1,176 country -\npairs) between 1988 and 2004. Using  two novel measures of pairwise GAAP differences between \ncountries (i.e. , the extent of  the difference between the GAAP the firm follows and the prevalent  \nGAAP  in the analyst’s home country), they find that foreign analyst following is negatively related to \nGAAP differences and weakly  associated with forecast accuracy. These results indicate the costs \nassociated with differences in accounting standards across countries  and speak of the potential benefit \nof accounting harmonization. That even sophisticated users of financial information  like analysts \nbenefit from accounting harmonization reveals  the potential gains for other  types of capital -market \nparticipants.  \nSeveral studies directly evaluate the effect s of voluntary and mandatory IFRS adoption on \nanalyst following and forecast properties.  Ashbaugh and Pincus (2001) examine a n international  \nsample of 80 non-US firms that voluntarily adopted IAS  from  1990 to 1993 . They contend that IAS \nadoption improves the predictability of earnings by restricting the choice of accounting measurement \nmethods that managers can adopt . Consistent with this, the y find  that the absolute values of analyst s’ \nforecast errors decline d after adoption and that t his decrease related cross -sectionally  to the effect  of \nadoption on a firm’s  accounting standards . Although  they attempt to control for the variety of \nobserved factors driving voluntary adoption, their analyses remain open to the self -selection concerns \nusual ly seen in studies of voluntary adoption . \n                                                            \n34 Although  Bae et al. (2008) do not focus  on IFRS adoption, in a supplementary analysis , they document that \nanalysts familiar with IAS are more likely to start following a firm after its voluntary IAS adoption.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 31}
page_content='31 \n Comparing mandatory IFRS adopters to firms that had earlier voluntarily adopted IFRS, \nByard , Li, and Yu  (2011) examine how the IFRS mandate affects analysts’ forecast errors. They find \nthat the absolute value of forecast errors and dispersion decrease s after mandatory IFRS  adoption  but \nonly for firms domiciled in countries with strong enforcement a nd where IFRS adoption significantly \nchanged accounting standards.  Bilinski, Lyssimachou, and Walker (2013) find that the improved \nanalyst performance following IFRS adoption can also be extend ed to analysts’ predictions of target \nprices.  Tan, Wang, and Welker  (2011) extend this line of thinking  to study the pervasiveness of the \nimprovements in analyst coverage and forecast accuracy across  analyst groups. They  find that , \nalthough  IFRS adoption increases coverage from both foreign and local analysts, it im proves the \nforecast accuracy of foreign analysts  only. They find IFRS has little effect on the forecasting ability of \nlocal analysts.    \nExamining why IFRS adoption  may i mprove analysts’ forecast accuracy for adopting firms, \nHorton, Serafeim, and Serafeim ( 2013) test whether the improvement arises from (i) a higher quality \nof IFRS, (ii) a greater comparability after IFRS adoption , or (iii) the additional  opportunities available \nto managers under IFRS to manipulate earnings to meet the forecasts.  To this  end, the authors  classify \nanalysts into three categories: ( i) those  who focus on only a single set of local GAAP in the pre -IFRS \nperiod but analyze  reports under both local GAAP and IFRS in the post -IFRS period , (ii) those  who \nfocus on a single  set of  local GA AP in the pre -IFRS period and switch entirely to IFRS reports in  the \npost-IFRS period , and ( iii) those  who focus on multiple sets of local GAAP in the pre -IFRS period but \nswitch entirely to IFRS reports in  the post-IFRS period. Horton et al. (2013) predict  that IFRS  \nadoption decrease s comparability for the first category of analysts, leave s comparability unaffected \nfor the second category , and improve s comparability for the third category. In contrast, they predict \nthat all three categories of analyst s bene fit from IFRS adoption if IFRS -related  benefits arise through \nimproved reporting quality. Their analysis supports the view that IFRS  helps analyst forecasting \nmainly through  the improv ement of  reporting quality and comparability. They find no evidence that \nmanagers engage in greater earnings management to meet analysts’ forecast s under IFRS . \nOne simple explanation for the observed improvements in analysts’ forecast accuracy is that \nmanagers provide more earnings guidance following IFRS  adoption . This vi ew emerges from the \nfindings of Li and Yang (2015) , who show that IFRS adoption is associated with an increased \ntendency of managers to provide earnings guidance . However, as Li and Yang (2015) attribute the \nincreases in management forecasts to improved re porting quality under IFRS and increased demand \nfor such information from analysts following IFRS adoption , the causal relationship between  the \neffects  of analyst and management forecast s remains unknown .' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 32}
page_content='32 \n 4.3. Effects of IFRS adoption  on cross -border capital flows  \nProponents of IFRS have consistently claimed that greater financial reporting quality and \nimproved comparability of financial reports under IFRS lead to more cross -border flow of  capital and \nbetter integration of capital markets (e.g. , Europe an Council 2002). These claims are based on the \npremise that foreign investors must devote significant resources to interpret the domestic GAAP  of \nother countries and that c ross-country discrepancies in accounting rules and practices create \nsignificant information barriers, leaving foreign investors at an informational disadvantage relative to \nlocal ones. \nAlong these lines , Bradshaw, Bushee, and Miller (2004) suggest that US institutional \ninvestors prefer non -US firms  whose accounting methods conform more closely to US GAAP. They \nfind that foreign firms exhibiting higher levels (changes) of US GAAP conformity have higher levels \nof US institutional ownership. They notably  find that increases in US GAAP conformity precede  \nincreases in US investment, indicating that accounting choice affects  investor capital allocation \ndecision s and that  diversity in accounting choices decreases  international investment. However, the \nrecent findings by Fang, Maffett, and Zhang (2015) suggest the opposite causality: US institutional \ninvestors drive  convergence  in accounting practices ; i.e., an increase in US institutional ownership \nprecedes  an increase in accounting comparability between foreign firms and their US industry peers.  \nStudies focusing directly on  IFRS adoption and cross -border capital flows offer  three major \narguments for why IFRS adoption may matter to foreign investors. First, by replacing unfamiliar \ncountry -specific reporting standards wi th a single set of standards with which  investors can \nfamiliarize themselves at a lower cost, IFRS can decrease the  information disadvantages of foreign \ninvestors relative to local ones (e.g., Yu and Wahid 2014) and help foreign investors assess foreign \nfirms and markets (Amiram, 2012). Second, as IFRS is often perceived as being of a higher quality \nthan many local GAAP, its adoption can decrease the degree of  information asymmetry between local \nand foreign investors. Finally, the use of harmonized accoun ting standards may increase the visibility \nof remote investments, putting these stocks on investors’ radars.   \nCovrig , DeFond, and Hung  (2007) provide early evidence o f the role of IAS adoption in \ninvestor allocation decisions. Focusing on  a sample of holdi ngs in non -US stocks by 25,000 mutual \nfunds around the world, Covrig et al. (2007) show that stock ownership by foreign mutual funds \nincreases with the voluntary adoption of IAS. After controlling for many standard determinants of \ninstitutional ownership such as size, analyst following, inclusion in the market index, cross -listings, \nchoice of auditor , and an array of financial characteristics, the authors find an almost 50% increase in \nforeign mutual fund ownership for IAS adopters relative to non -IAS adopters. When they partition the \nsample into two groups based on firms’ information environment or visibility, t hey find IAS-adoption' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 33}
page_content='33 \n induced  changes in foreign mutual fund ownership to be pronounced for voluntary adopters located in \npoorer information environments and with lower visibility , indicating  heterogeneity in  the adoption \neffects. As a firm’s information environment and visibility are likely to be correlated with its decision \nto adopt IAS, the las t result could  also be driven by  differences in firm s’ incentives to adopt IAS.  \nKhurana and Michas (2011) extend the preceding  analyses to the context of mandatory IFRS \nadoption and find that IFRS adoption decreases US investors’  home  bias, which is the extent to which \ninvestors overweigh t US stocks in their portfolio s relative to stocks in the country mandating IFRS.  \nBased on  a sample of 85 countries , 33 of which mandated IFRS from 2003  through 2007, the authors \nfind that US home bias decrease d for inves tments in firms domiciled in IFRS -adopting countries  \nrelative to those in firms in countries that did not change their  accounting standards. These results are \nstronger for IFRS -adopting countries that exhibit  larger differences between IFRS and domestic \naccounting standards, a stricter rule of law, and greater incentives to report high quality financial \ninformation.   \nShima and Gordon (2011) also examine the effect of IFRS adoption on the investment \ndecisions of US investors  but scale their main variable of interest (i.e., the dollar investments by US \ninvestors in a foreign market) by the GDP of the foreign country rather than by the weight of the \nforeign country’s stocks in world -market capitalization , an approach taken  by K hurana and Michas \n(2011). In contrast to Khurana and Michas (2011), the y find no evidence to suggest that IFRS  \nadoption decrease d home bias from 2003  through 2006, unless such adoption occu rred in a country \nwith a strong regulatory environment.  \nFlorou and  Pope (2012) examine how IFRS adoption affects institutional ownership by \nstudying  the investment allocation decisions of a large sample of international institutional investors \nover the 2003 -2006  period . They show that the percentage  of institutional ownership and number of \ninstitutional investors increase d in countries mandatorily adopting IFRS relative to a control sample of \ncountries that d id not mandate IFRS. Using firm -level data in a difference -in-difference s analysis, \nthey report an average increase in institutional ownership of 1.4% in the period immediately following \nthe IFRS  transition quarter. These  changes in institutional ownership are also more marked for active \ninvestors, whose investment decisions rely on financial stateme nt data relative to passive investors , \ncorroborating the claim that ownership changes are caused by IFRS. As the authors do not distinguish \nbetween domestic and foreign institutional investors, it is unclear whether the documented ownership \nchanges are due  to IFRS improving reporting quality and thereby inducing domestic institutions to \nincrease their ownership or to the harmonization of accounting standards attracting foreign investors.  \nYu and Wahid (2014) extend preceding  analyses by focusing  specificall y on foreign mutual \nfund holdings around IFRS adoption.   They show that foreign mutual funds also increase their' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 34}
page_content='34 \n ownership stakes in firms domiciled in IFRS -adopting countries.  They relate these ownership changes \nto changes in accounting distance (i.e., difference s in accounting standards) between the investee and \ninvestor’s countries . To give a sense of the economic magnitude of this effect , they point out that , if \nthe differences in accounting standards across the US and South Africa were eliminated, th en the US \nmutual funds would  decrease their underweighting of South African stocks by approximately 14%. In \nan additional analysis, the authors examine changes in accounting distance driven  only by  IFRS \nadoption in the investor  fund’s country, i.e. , there are no change s in the accounting standards of the \ninvestee  firm. Even in this setting , the authors continue to find that mutual funds increase their \ninvestment weights in the investee  firms, indicating that an investor’s  increased familiarity with  an \ninves tee’s accounting standards encourages cross -border investments.  \nDeFond , Hu, Hung, and Li (2011) attempt to more directly identify the specific accounting \nattributes that explain the increased attention of international institutional investors following IF RS \nadoption. The y contend that increases in cross -border investment following IFRS adoption are driven \nby improvement s in comparability , which lowers information acquisition costs for global investors.  \nTesting this assertion on a sample of 14 IFRS -mandating EU countries and 10 non -IFRS countries for \nthe 2003 –2007  period (excluding the IFRS transition year), t hey find that IFRS adoption results in \ngreater investment by foreign mutual funds for firms experienc ing large r increase s in accounting  \nuniformity .35 \nAlthough  progress has been made in understanding the effects of IFRS adoption for \ninstitutional investors, very little research has explored  the effects of adoption on  the trading patterns \nof retail investors . This is at least partly due to a lack of comprehensive data related to  retail trades. \nBruggemann, Daske, Homburg, and Pope (2012) attempt to circumvent this problem by analyzing \ntrading volume in the Open Market of the  Frankfurt Stock Exchange , a trading venue primarily \ndesigned to attract small German investors interested in foreign stocks. Based on difference -in-\ndifference s analysis, they document an increase in trading volume following the EU’s mandatory \nIFRS adoption in 2005, suggesting that retail investors benefit  from IFRS rep orts. However , cross -\nsectional analysis  reveals that  these effects are more pronounced for trading in stocks that have  \nincreased media coverage  following IFRS adoption , which  raise s the possibility that the observed \ntrading effects may not be directly attr ibutable to IFRS adoption but may reflect investors’ responses \nto the greater media coverage.  \nAlthough  the preceding  studies focus on specific subsamples of foreign investors, such as \nmutual funds, US investors, institutional investors , and retail investors, Amiram (2012) shows that the \n                                                            \n35 For each industry -country, Defond et al. (2011) measure accounting uniformity as the number of firms in that \nindustry and country u sing IFRS in the post-IFRS -adoption period, divided by the number of firms in that \nindustry and country using local accounting standards in the pre-IFRS -adoption period.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 35}
page_content='35 \n evidence in these  studies can be generalize d to country -level foreign portfolio investments (FPI).  \nThat is, the tendency of investors to invest in IFRS countries is observable even when one analy zes \ndata related to  all of the  non-controlling equity stakes in a country purchased by foreign entities. He \nalso finds that it is primarily investors from countries that use IFRS who increase their investments in \nother IFRS -adopting countries rather than investors from  countries that do not use IFRS , which \nimplies that the increased cross -border investments are mainly attributable to investors’ familiarity  \nwith IFRS, rather than to IFRS improving reporting quality or appealing to all foreign investors.  \nAlthough  most stu dies of cross -border investments around IFRS adoption focus  exclusively \non equity investments, Beneish, Miller, and Yohn (2014) study both equity and debt investments.  \nThey find that  post-IFRS  increases in cross -border investments of equity, as reflected in country -level \nFPI data, are mainly driven by US investors . More interestingly, they find that the effects of IFRS on \ncross -border debt investments are stronger and that IFRS adoption attract s new debt  investors from a \nwider set of countries, including the US and other non-IFRS countries. The authors conclude that \nIFRS adoption benefits debt investors more than equity investors.  \nOverall, there appears to be a consensus in the empirical eviden ce that IFRS adoption is \nassociated with increases in cross -border capital flows . Although  initial studies attribute these \nincreases  to both improved transparency and comparability  under IFRS , more recent studies point \ntoward greater famili arity of investor s with IFRS as the source of improvement.  However , these \nfindings leave some unanswered questions . What is the causal relationship , following IFRS adoption , \nbetween changes in stock liquidity (discussed in the next subsection) and cross -border cap ital flows?   \nWhat are the effect s of larger cross -border capital flow s on the size of equity  markets  and the \neconomy of IFRS -adopting countries relative to those of the countries from where the investments \nflow out?  How does IFRS adoption affect investment  risks and returns on cross -border capital flows?  \n4.4. Effects of IFRS adoption on market liquidity and cost of capital  \nSeveral theoretical models have been developed to understand the link between information \nquality and liquidity in addition to  cost of capital . Although th e literature is not specifically directed at \nIFRS adoption , these models provide a basis for empirical tests o f the effects of IFRS adoption on \nstock liquidity and cost of capital .  Hence, we review th e literature in Section 4.4.1.  Section 4.4.2 \nthen presents  the empirical evidence for voluntary IFRS adopters, and Section 4.4.3 discusses  the \nevidence for mandatory adopt ers. \n4.4.1.  Theoretical predictions of  the effect s of reporting quality on liquidity and cost of capital  \n Two mechanisms  are generally employed  to link quality of accounting information  with \nliquidity and cost of capital: estimation risk and information asymmetry , both of which are  often' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 36}
page_content='36 \n referred to as “information risk .” Estimation risk refers to the uncertai nty associated with investors’ \nassessments of the parameters of an asset’s return or payoff distribution, and information asymmetry \nrelate s to the risk facing liquidity traders from potentially trading with better informed investors. \nIncreasing information  (i.e., greater and more precise accounting disclosures) allows for both a lower \nestimation risk and convergent opinions on the part of all investors, which improve s risk sharing and \nthus decreases  the cost of capital (e.g. , Barry and Brown 1985; Coles and Lowenstein  1988). Barry \nand Brown (1985) show in a Bayesian framework that risk -averse investors prefer securities in which \nmore information is available, as these securities present a lower estimation risk for investors.  They \npoint out that , when  such investor preferences are consistent across the market, equilibrium prices are \nhigher for firms with better information and such a firm’s cost of capital is lower. This study and \nsubsequent studies conducted along this line (e. g., Coles and Lowenstein 1988) show that parameter \nuncertainty affects investors ’ estimation s of beta and so are not diversifiable.36 \nOn a related note , information asymmetry between potential buyers and sellers of shares can \nintroduce adverse selection int o the share markets and decrease  market liquidity. In response to the \nlower liquidity, stock prices decrease  to compensate investors for holding illiquid stocks and lead to \nan increased cost of capital for the firm. However, firms can decrease  this cost by  improving the level \nor precision of disclosures , which lowers the degree of information asymmetry between investors and \neventually the cost of capital (e.g. , Amihud and Mendelson 1986; Diamond and Verre cchia 1991; \nEasley and O’Hara 2004 ). In addition, Diamond and Verre cchia (1991) provide an alternative path for \nrelating disclosure levels to cost of capital : greater disclosures decrease  the adverse price  effect  of the \ntrade, mitigating investor concerns about taking large stakes in a firm.  This increase s demand for \nsecurities, which , through improved liquidity , decreases the  cost of capital.  \nThe preceding  models generally derive their results from  a single -asset economy (or multiple \nassets where the cash flows of firms are uncorrelated). In contrast, Lam bert et al.  (2007) develop a \nmodel in which the quality of accounting information can affect the cost of equity capital in an \neconomy with multiple  assets  whose payoffs are correlated . Under a CAPM framework with perfect \ncompetition , they show that accounting information quality affects the cost of capital through a firm’s \nbeta and that, once an appropriately  measured beta is controlled for , accounting quality should not \nrelate to expected returns.37 Studying the interplay between informatio n asymmetry and cost of capital \n                                                            \n36 In an economy where the level of disclosure is the same for all firms, estimation ri sk can be diversified away.  \nHowever, Barry and Brown (1985) show that differential information (i.e., cross -firm differences in the amount \nof available information about the firm) affects pricing.  \n37 Easley and O’Hara (2004) develop a model in which firms with less public and more private information face \na greater information risk and higher expected returns.  They argue that , due to their information disadvantage \nrelative to informed investors, uninf ormed investors  end up holding suboptimal portfolios with too many  stocks \nwith pending bad news and too few with pending good news. As this risk cannot be diversified away by holding \nmore stocks, the risk gets priced in equilibrium. However, Lambert et al.  (2007, pp. 396 –397) point out that the \ninformation effect on stock prices is diversified away when the number of traders becomes large.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 37}
page_content='37 \n in a large economy, Hughes, Liu , and Liu (2007) similarly show that private information signals \naffect either market risk premium or factor loadings, depending on whether the private signal relates \nto systematic risk factors  or idiosyncratic shocks. However, the information asymmetry arising from \nprivate signals about idiosyncratic shocks does not matter directly to cost of capital. That is, after \naccounting for betas, the information asymmetry has no effect on cost of capita l. \nArmstrong, Core, Taylor, and Verre cchia (2011) attempt to reconcile the contradict ory \ntheoretical predictions for the effect of information asymmetry on cost of capital by proposing that \ninformation asymmetry matters for pricing stocks only when markets  are imperfect. They conjecture \nthat, in perfectly competitive markets where individual traders’ demands do not affect stock prices, \ninformation asymmetry is irrelevant for stock pricing.  However, in imperfect security markets, \ninformation asymmetry has a separate effect on cost of capital, beyond any effect through other risk \nfactors. Using the number of shareholders a firm has as a proxy for  the level of competition \nsurrounding the  firm’s shares, the  authors  provide evidence consistent with their conjecture  related to  \nUS stocks . \nIn one of the very few theoretical studies t o directly evaluate the effect of global \nharmonization on stock  market performance, Barth, Clinch, and Shibano (1999) present a model that \nshows that the effect of accounting harmonization on price information and trading volume in a \nmarket depends on the interaction of two forces: (i) whether the harmonization improves or worsens \nthe information revealed through financial statements and (ii)  the extent of the net benefits accru ed to \nforeign investors by becoming more familiar with a firm’s financial reporting standards. The latter \nforce  is assumed to depend on the former, as poorer information quality increases returns to informed \ntrading. Ba sed on the interaction of these two forces, Barth et al. (1999) show that the harmonization \nof better quality accounting standards may not necessarily improve stock  market performance and \nvice versa.  \nThe preceding  theoretical predictions suggest that  IFRS adoption will improve stock liquidity  \nprovided it improve s reporting quality for stock investors. However,  its effect on  cost of capital is \nambiguous, especially after controlling for firms’ betas.  We now turn our attention to empirical \nevidence o f the link age between financial reporting quality, stock market liquidity , and cost of capital.   \n4.4.2.  Empirical evidence based on voluntary IFRS adoption  \nEarly studies of  the effects of IFRS adoption  on stock markets typically rel y on firms from a \nhandful of Europ ean countries that allowed voluntar y adoption of IAS.  In fact, many of the studies \nfocus  specifically  on German firms , as voluntary adoption was more common among the m.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 38}
page_content='38 \n Leuz and Verrec chia (2000) compare proxies for stock liquidity , namely, bid-ask spread, \ntrading volume , and return volatility , across German firms voluntarily report ing under either IAS or \nUS GAAP  versus those reporting under local German GAAP . Arguing  that IAS and US GAAP have \nhigher quality disclosure requirements, they  predict that  firms committing  to report under IAS or US \nGAAP should have lower information asymmetry and better stock liquidity  than those report ing under \nGerman GAAP . Consistent with this prediction, they find that firms reporting their 1997 financial \nreports under IAS or US GAAP exhibit lower bid -ask spreads and higher share turnover s but not \ndifferent share price volatilit ies. Although the ir analysis  is based on the greater disclosure levels \nrequired under IAS or US GAAP , it does not distinguish between the effects of disclosure quality and \nthose of the quality of recognized financial numbers.  Moreover, as it relies on a very small sample of \n14 IAS adopters and seven US GAAP adopters, its generalizability presents a probl em. \nIn a related study, Leuz (2003) compare s the  stock liquidity of firms in Germany’s former \nNew Market that report under IAS with firms from the same market that adopt US GAAP. The author \nargues that, except for differences in accounting regulation s, these two groups of firms face identical  \nregulations and therefore any  differences in the information asymmetry or stock liquidity proxies \nacross these groups should reflect the relative reporting quality of the two accounting standards.  Leuz \n(2003) finds ins ignificant difference s in the bid-ask spread s and share turnover between  the two \ngroups, indicating that the mere adoption of either IAS or US GAAP is not sufficient to improve these \nfirms’ reporting quality relative to each other.  In a closely related wor k, Bartov et al. (2005) study \nhow the value relevance of accounting numbers var ies across German firms reporting under IAS, US \nGAAP , or German GAAP. Although  they find  that firms reporting under US GAAP or IAS have \nbetter value relevance, they do not find any significant difference in value relevance between firms \nreporting under  US GAAP and IAS. The ir findings , along with  those of  Leuz (2003),  indicate \nminimal stock  market benefits from adopting IFRS relative to US GAAP . \nDaske (2006) provides some of  the e arliest evidence o f the link between choice of accounting \nstandards and cost of capital estimates. Using analyst consensus forecasts from  IBES, Daske (2006) \nestimates the implied cost of equity capital for a sample of German firms between 1993 and 2002  and \nfinds no evidence to suggest that  it is lower for firms reporting under IAS or US GAAP than for  firms \nreporting under German GAAP. In fact, he finds that the cost of equity increase s when firms switch \nfrom local GAAP to IAS or US GAAP , which he speculates  may reflect the effects of the decreased \ncomparability of these firms’ financial reports relative to those of other German firms.  Although  this \nstudy takes an important step by connecting accounting standards to cost of capital, its implied cost of \ncapital estimates are based on analysts’ forecasts, whose properties are affected by  choice of \naccounting standards  (see the discussion in Section 4.2) . These  may add noise to  the analyses \nsurround ing the accounting standard  changes.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 39}
page_content='39 \n Recognizing that firms have discretion in how they implement new accounting standards, \nDaske , Hail, Leuz, and Verdi  (2013) re -examine the observed liquidity and cost of capital effects \naround voluntary (and mandatory) adoption. Their analysis incorporates changes  in firm -level \nreporting incentives and behavior  around the time of adoption to classify firms as either “serious” or \n“label” adopters.38 “Serious” adopters are firms that experienced significant changes in incentives \naround IAS adoption and for whom  adoption forms part of a broader commitment to transparency.  \n“Label” adopters are firms that experienced  little or no change in observable incentives around the \ntime of adoption and thus did not make significant changes to their reporting policies. Based  on an \ninternational sample (spanning 30 countries ) of voluntary IAS adopters between 1990 and 2005, the \nauthors fail to find any noticeable effects on liquidity (measured as the effects  of trades and bid -ask \nspreads  on price ) or implied cost of capital es timates for voluntary adopters, relative to local -GAAP \nfirms and  a firm’s own pre -IAS history. However, once they use concurrent changes in reporting \nincentives  as a condition , they find that “serious” adopters experience improvements in liquidity and \ndeclines in cost of capital relative to “label” adopters. In addition, they find that serious adopters \nexperience a net increase in Tobin’s Q. The y find the same pattern of results surrounding mandatory \nIFRS adoption. Daske et al. (2013)  provide evidence that simply adopting IAS/IFRS does not \nnecessarily lead to the purported stock  market benefits unless firm -level reporting incentives are also \naligned. Their evidence corroborates the findings of Ball et al. (2003)  and also provides some insight \ninto the nature of the heterogeneous  outcomes previously observed around IAS/IFRS adoption.  \nOverall, the evidence related to  voluntary adoption is mixed . Although  some studies find \nevidence of reductions in information asymmetry and stock liquidity  (e.g., Leuz and Verre cchia \n2000), other studies document little support for the claim that voluntary IFRS adoption by itself \nimprove s liquidity or decrease s cost of capital  (Daske 2006; Daske et al. 2013). Although studies of \nvoluntary adoption typically attempt to control for self -selection using traditional econometric \napproaches, one cannot be entirely confident that self -selection biases do not affect  these results.  \n4.4.3.  Empirical evidence based on mandatory IFRS adoption  \nUsing firm -year panel data for mand atory  IFRS adopters from 26 countries and covering 2001  \nthrough 2005, Daske, Hail, Leuz, and Verdi (2008) examine the effects of mandatory IFRS adoption \non stock liquidity, cost of capital , and Tobin’s Q. Relying on a benchmark of firms that do not report \nunder IFRS (due to either being domiciled in a non -adopting country or not being required to \n                                                            \n38 Daske et al. (2013) use three proxies to identify major changes in ﬁrm -level reporting incentives related to  \nvoluntary (and mandatory) IAS adoption.  The ﬁrst is the primary factor drawn from factor analysis of a variety \nof firm attributes, such as size, leverage, profitability, book -to-market ratio, percentage of closely held shares , \nand percentage of foreign sa les to total sales.  The second is the negative of the ratio of absolute value of accruals \nto the absolute value of cash ﬂow from operations . The final proxy is the number of analysts following a ﬁrm. \nThe authors then use the  change s in these proxies over s ix years around IAS to sort firms into “serious ” and \n“label ” adopters based on whether the change s are above or below the median change.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 40}
page_content='40 \n mandatorily adopt IFRS in 2005) as control firms, the y find a significant improvement in liquidity for \nmandatory IFRS adopters. They also find a significant increase in cost of capital and a significant \ndecrease  in Tobin’s Q.  However, when the  authors  examine  the stock  market effects in the one year \nbefore  IFRS adoption, they find that cost of capital decreases  by 26 basis points and T obin’s Q \nincrease s by 7%.  They conclude that the IFRS benefits may be  reflected in stock prices as soon as \nIFRS adoption is anticipated. However, from a theoretical perspective, it is unclear why investors \ndecrease the  premium for information risk even bef ore the risk is attenuated  and despite the \nsignificant uncertainty around IFRS implementation and its effect on reporting quality (as discussed in \nSection 2.4) in the year before  IFRS adoption. It is also unclear  why cost of capital actually increase s \nif information risk decreases upon  the IFRS adoption date.  The authors’  findings also leave \nunanswered the question of why the effects on cost of capital and Tobin’s Q precede mandatory \nadoption  when uncertainty about the reporting effects of IFRS remained h igh (see discussion  in \nSection 2.4 ). \nBased on cross -sectional analyses, Daske et al. (2008) document that the observed stock  \nmarket benefits occur only in countries with strict enforcement regimes and in countries where firms \nhave incentives to be transpar ent. They  are careful to point out that some or all of their results may \nreflect the effects of a variety of regulatory and enforcement changes that are instituted along with \nIFRS  adoption and that mandatory adoption itself may play a limited role in causing the observed \noutcomes.  \nLike Daske et al. (2008), Li (2010)  investigates whether mandatory adoption of IFRS  affects  \ncost of equity capital. Based on difference -in-difference s analysis of a set of 1,084 EU firms, she \nconcludes that  mandatory adopters  enjoy a significant reduction of 47 basis points in the ir cost of \nequity , but that no such change occurs around the IFRS mandate date for a control sample of \nvoluntary adopters .39 A possible reason for these differences in the main results  is that, unlike Daske \net al. (2008) , she does not control for time trends.  Notwithstanding these differences , she finds that \nonly firms  in countries with strong legal enforcement  benefit from reductions in cost of equity capital . \nThis suggests that the differences in the countries covered in the sample may explain the differences \nin main results across the two studies.  \nRather than limiting  their focus to  IFRS adoption indicator s, Platikanova and Perramon \n(2012) study how new information revealed through IFRS adoption (contained in the reconciliation of \nIFRS to local GAAP) relate s to stock liquidity. They  find that , although  the reconciliation numbers \n(relative to industry peers) for shareholders’ equity are not unambiguous ly related to stock liquidity, \nthose  for net income are significantly negatively related to it. The authors suggest that larger net \n                                                            \n39 Li (2010) measures cost of equity capital as the average implied cost of capital measures estimated from the \nfour different valuation models.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 41}
page_content='41 \n income differences reflect greater uncertainty about IFRS adjustments in  the transition yea r and that \nthis uncertainty lower s stock liquidity .  \nChristensen  et al.  (2013) re -evaluate the evidence provided by  Daske et al. (2008) after \naccount ing for  enforcement and regulatory changes concurrent with mandatory IFRS adoption  in \nsome EU countries . Based on a survey of regulators, practitioners, and academics and information \nfrom public sources, they classify five European countries  (Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway , \nand the UK) as undergo ing substantive enforcement changes concurrent  with manda tory IFRS \nadoption. They also compare the  liquidity changes  surrounding  IFRS adoption across four groups of \ncountrie s: (i) EU countries with concurrent enforcement changes , (ii) EU countries with out concurrent \nenforcement changes , (iii)  non-EU countries adopting IFRS , and (iv) countries not adopting IFRS . \nThey document that the effects of IFRS introduction  on stock liquidity  are limited to the five \nEuropean countries undergo ing concurrent  changes in enforcement.  Moreover, they find similar \nliquidity impro vements for firms that are experienc ing changes in enforcement regime s but are not \nconcurrently chang ing their accounting standards . Based on these findings, they conclude that \nchanges in reporting enforcement or other correlated omitted factors help explain the liquidity \nchanges observed around IFRS adoption and that changes in accounting standards have had little \ndirect effect on market liquidity. However, Barth and Israeli (2013) contend that the evidence \nprovided by  Christensen et al. (2013) is ins ufficient to attribute the liquidity changes to enforcement \nchanges  alone  and that both IFRS adoption and enforcement changes may be required for firms to \nbenefit  from improved stock liquidity.  \nIn contrast to the  preceding  studies’ focus on the effects of IFRS adoption on stock liquidity \nand cost of capital , Hong, Hung, and Lobo (2014) illuminate another capital market consequence by \nevaluat ing the effect of IFRS adoption on  the underpricing  of initial public offerings ( IPOs). As IPO \nunderpricing is at least partly caused by information asymmetry between informed and uninformed \ninvestors , IFRS adoption can help decrease IPO underpricing by decreasing  information asymmetry . \nIn addition, the  authors  point out that IFRS adoption can lower IPO underpricing by attracting more \nforeign investors’ attention to the stock.  To test their prediction, they adopt  a difference -in-difference s \nresearch design involving  a treatment sample of 1,540 IPO firms from mandatory -IFRS -adopting \ncountries and  a propensity -scored matched sample of IPO firms from  non-IFRS -adopting  countries . \nTheir findings suggest that IPO underpricing decreases significantly (38 %–82%) for IFRS -adopting \nfirms.  Moreover, they show that  IPO firms attract significantly more foreign  proceeds (49 %–76%) \nafter mandatory IFRS adoption . Cross -sectional analyses reveal tha t the results are limited to \ncountries with strong enforcement regime s and those that were significantly affected  by IFRS \nadoption (i.e., with large differences between I FRS and prior local GAAP ).' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 42}
page_content='42 \n In summary, e mpirical analyses of stock  market benefits generally reveal that voluntary and \nmandatory IFRS adoption have  increase d market liquidity and decreased  the cost of equity capital. \nHowever, these benefits have not  been experienced by all firms  or within all countries . Rather,  they \nhave been  concentrated in firms that have undergone  concurrent changes in firm -level reporting \nincentives and in countries that have undergone  concurrent changes to enforcement.  As we discuss i n \ndetail in Section 10, studies focusing on mandatory IFRS adoption are susceptible to a confounding -\nevents problem, raising concerns about the precise cause of the observed effects of the  IFRS mandate. \nTo address such concerns, more  research is required t o obtain  a clearer understanding of the links \nbetween IFRS adoption and its effects on stock markets. For instance, c urrent IFRS studies do not \nclosely tie their empirical analysis of cost of capital to predictions derived from specific theoretical \nmodels . It is necessary to do so , as theoretical predictions of the effect of information quality on cost \nof capital are model -dependent (as discussed in Section 4.4.1).  Future research should also delve \ndeeper into  the precise properties of IFRS and enforcement that underpin the observed benefits related \nto liquidity and cost of capital . Which types of enforcement or wh ich specific IFRS attributes  yield \ngreater stock market benefits?  \n \n5. IFRS and corporate decision -making   \n5.1. E mpirical predictions and US -based evidence  \nThere are several reasons to expect changes in accounting standards and the attendant effect \non reporting quality  to influence  corporate decision -making. Several studies  show that better reporting \nquality decreases  information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders, which in turn attracts capital \nto positive net-present -value  projects and increases investment opportunities by lowering investors’ \nrequired returns  (e.g., Biddle, Hillary , and Verdi 2009; Ram an, Shivakumar , and Tamayo 2012; \nGoodman, Neamtiu, Shroff , and White 2014) . Better financial reporting quality also enhance s the \neffectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms and thus mitigate s managerial excesses , including \nunder - and overinvestment s. Reported accounting numbers  are often used in debt  covenants , and so  \nchanges to accounting standards can tighten or loosen covenant slack and affect  the funds available \nfor investments  and other corporate purposes  (Shroff 2015) . Furthermore , new accounting standards \noften require managers to gather additional information, which can  affect managerial decision -\nmaking.   \nChanges in accounting standards can also affect  the decision -making of firms through \nspillover effects  from other firms’ finan cial reports . For instance, more transparent reporting by all of \nthe firms in an economy can benefit a firm by decreasing  its uncertainty over the strategies of  peer \nfirms.  Durnev and Mangen (2009) posit and show that a competitor ’s accounting  restatements  transfer' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 43}
page_content='43 \n information about the general profitability of investment projects to other firms . Admati and \nPfleiderer (2000) also suggest that , in a world where firm values are correlated, mandating higher \ndisclosure quality enhances  welfare, as higher quality disclosures allow investors to arrive at more \naccurate valuations for not only the disclosing firm but also its peers. This is also likely to affect \ncorporate decisions by influencing capital allocation across firms. A number of  US-based studies \nprovide empirical evidence in support of these spillover effects of reporting quality ( e.g., Foster 1981; \nFreeman and Tse 1992 ; Durnev and Mangen 2009; Badertscher at al. 2013; Shroff et al. 201 4).  \n5.2. IFRS and corporate investment efficiency  \nOne of the first studies  to consider  investment efficiency in the IFRS  adoption context is that \nby Schleicher, Tahoun, and Walker (2010) , who investigate how IFRS adoption affects investment \nefficiency  in an international setting. They argue that improved reporting quality under IFRS should \nimprove  investment efficiency and that this improvement should be more pronounced in inside \neconomies (i.e. , economies  with small stock markets, highly concentrated ownership, weak outside \ninvestor rights, poor disclosure levels , and weak legal enforcement)  than in outside economies , as the \nformer are more prone to agency problems and financial constraints . Along similar lines, they suggest \nthat the effects of IFRS should be more noticeable for smaller firms, whi ch are generally more \nfinancially constrained. Measuring  investment efficiency based on the sensitivity of investments to \ncash flows, the authors  report results that are consistent with these predictions , i.e., reductions in \ninvestment -cash flow sensitivit y following IFRS adoption are greater for insider economies and for \nsmaller firms . Biddle, Callahan, Hong , and Knowles (2013) extend these findings to a larger sample \nand adopt  a difference -in-differences approach that encompasses both IFRS -adopting and non-IFRS -\nadopting countries and show  that the conclusions of Schleicher et al. (2010) are robust.  \nChen, Young , and Zhuang (2013) examine the effect of IFRS adoption on  the cross -border \nspillover of investment -related information. They specifically investig ate how IFRS adoption affects  \nthe relation ship between the investment efficiency  of a firm  and the investment performance  of its \nforeign peers  based on a sample of over 1,000 IFRS -adopting firms from 17 European countries \nbetween 2000 and 2009 . They show that IFRS adoption increases the sensitivity of a firm’s \ninvestment efficiency to performance -related information about  its foreign peers but not to \ninformation about  its domestic peers . Based on this,  they conclude  that enhanced  cross -border \ncomp arability following IFRS adoption drive s the documented results.  \nLouis and Urcan (2014) examine how mandatory IFRS adoption affects managerial decisions \npertaining to M&A. As accounting reports play a crucial role in the initial screening and identificatio n \nof target firms, they argue that acquirers should be able to better screen targets from other countries \nwith comparable accounting standards, suggesting that widespread IFRS adoption should increase' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 44}
page_content='44 \n cross -border acquisitions . They also point out that  the use of identical accounting standards by both \nacquirer and target  should simplify post -acquisition integrations . This should also increase the \nlikelihood of IFRS -reporting entit ies merging . Consistent with these predictions, they find that the \nodds of cross -border acquisition s of listed firm s from IFRS -adopting countries significantly increase  \nin the post -IFRS period relative to corresponding  increase s for either unlisted firms in IFRS -adopting \ncountries or listed firms from non -IFRS countries. This eff ect is not driven by countries that change \ntheir enforcement s or regulation s concurrently with IFRS adoption . Rather, it  primarily occurs when \nthe acquiring firm is also from an IFRS -adopting country. Based on these findings, the authors \nconclude that impr oved comparability rather than changes in reporting quality resulting from IFRS \nadoption causes an increase in cross -border M&A.  \nFrancis, Huang, and Khurana (2015) also investigate whether differences in accounting \nstandards across countries affect cross -border M&A.  Using cross -border M&A data from 32 countries \nover 1998  through 2004, they show that the volume of cross -border transactions is larger between \ncountries with similar accounting standards.  They also report that mandatory IFRS adoption has \nincreased cross -border M&A across countries that exhibited  larger differences  in their domestic \nGAAP  in the pre -IFRS period.  However, neither  Francis et al. (2015) nor Louis and Urcan (2014) \nidentify the specific costs that are so large as to dissuade the acquisition of targets reporting under an \nalternative accounting standard.  \nShroff et al. (2014) examine whether the information environment in which a subsidiary \noperates affects its investment decisions using IFRS adoption as an exogenous sho ck to firms’ \ninformation environment. The authors  hypothesize that more transparent information, such as that \npresented under IFRS, allows multinational companies to better monitor  the investment decisions of \ntheir foreign subsidiaries . Consistent with thi s, they show that the investment decisions of foreign \nsubsidiaries in country  industries with more transparent information environments are more \nresponsive to local growth opportunities than foreign subsidiaries in  country  industries with less \ntransparent information environments .  \nRelated ly, Loureiro and Taboada (2015) examine whether and how IFRS adoption affects the \nsensitivity of managerial decisions  to stock price  information , i.e., whether insiders can “learn” from \noutsiders. They argue that an improved information environment such as that under  IFRS adoption \nallows managers to learn more from investors’ information set s, as reflected in the stock prices . They \ntest this prediction by following a difference -in-difference s approach using  both non -adopters and \nvoluntary adopters as control groups. Based on  a sample of over 32,000 firms from 50 countries over \n1990  through 2012, they show  that relative to the control sample, IFRS adopters experience an \nincrease in  investment -to-price sensitiv ity, a stronger relation ship between market reaction s to M&A \nannouncements and  the likelihood of deal completion, and an improvement in post -acquisition' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 45}
page_content='45 \n operating and return performance  following adoption . The authors attribute their results to increase s \nin information provided by  new foreign investors , rather than current investors  providing more \ninformation post  adoption .  \n5.3. IFRS and other corporate decisions  \nHail, Tahoun, and Wang (2014) examine how changes in a firm’s information environment \naffect its dividend payout policies.  They point out  that an improved information environment such as \nthat under  IFRS adoption can either increase or decrease  dividend payouts  by improving managerial \nmonitoring and mitigat ing agency problems . Although  improved monitoring decreases  the need for \nmanagers to signal their quality by paying out excess cash , causing lower dividend payouts, it can also \ndecrease  overinvestment and lead managers to distribute excess cash through higher dividend payouts.   \nThe aut hors test these contradicting predictions based on difference -in-difference s analysis of an \ninternational sample of firms covering  49 countries over 1993  through 2008. Their logit analysis \nreveals that the propensity to pay dividends decreases by about 9% after IFRS adoption, relative to a \nbenchmark sample of non -adopting firms . \nWang and Welker (2011) examine whether firms strategically time equity issuance s during \nthe transition period leading up to IFRS, when information asymmetry between management and \ninvestors was temporarily high. They suggest that managers, who had inside knowledge of the \nnegative effects  of IFRS on reported numbers, strategically issu ed equity before the information was \npublicly released.  Based on  a sample of 2,900 non -financial firms from Australia and Europe, they \ninitially provide evidence of greater information asymmetry between managers and investors of \nequity -issuing firms by doc umenting a stronger association between abnormal stock returns after \nIFRS  adoption (when the effects of IFRS were revealed publicly) and the difference in net incomes \nreported under local GAAP and IFRS  relative to non -issuing firms.  They then document a \nsignificantly negative relation ship between the  earnings differences across  IFRS and local GAAP , the \nprobability of issuing equity , and the amount issued in the three years leading up to IFRS adoption.  \nChen, Ng, and Tsang (2015) examine whether mandatory IFRS  adoption affects cross -listing \ndecisions.  They point out that IFRS  adoption  may increase incentives to  cross -list by lowering the \ncosts associated with financial reporting across multiple jurisdictions and lowering  investors’ costs of \nprocessing finan cial reports prepared under unfamiliar accounting standards . However,  IFRS  adoption \nmay also decrease a firm’s need to cross -list by attracting foreign investors and analysts to local \nmarkets.  Based on  a sample of 1,181 cross -listed firms ( including 608 from IFRS -adopting \ncountries) , Chen et al.  (2015) find that firms in IFRS -adopting countries are more likely to cross -list \nafter mandatory adoption  than firms reporting under non -IFRS standards or firms that had voluntarily \nadopted IFRS  earlier . They also find that adopters tend to cross -list in more countries , in other IFRS -' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 46}
page_content='46 \n adopting jurisdictions , and in countries with larger and more liquid security markets.  Cross -sectional \ntests reveal that the cross -listing effect of mandatory IFRS adoption is greater f or firms domiciled in \ncountries exhibiting  larger differences between local  GAAP and IFRS, lower disclosure levels , and \nless access to external capital before adoption.  \nOverall , although  initial efforts have been made to  better understand the effects of the IFRS \nmandate on corporate decisions, this  topic offers opportunities for future research.  Have improved \ncross -border comparability and increased cross -border information transfers  led to the better \neconomic integration of countries? Ha ve they increased  competition in IFRS -adopting countries, \nespecially from foreign firms? By improving  monitoring  and efficien cy of  decisions and lower ing \ncosts of capital , has IFRS adoption increased  the economic profitability of firms ? Or  has it hurt \neconomic profitability by attract ing greater competition , particularly from foreign firms?  Future \nstudies should strive to explain the mechanisms through which these real effects occur.  \n \n6. IFRS  and debt markets  \nFew studies evaluate  the effects of  IFRS  on debt markets. The arguments related to the effects \nof IFRS in the context of equity markets cannot  always  be directly extend ed to debt market s due to  \nthe asymmetric payoff function  of debtholders . For instance, although  shareholders may care more \nabout  the current market value of a borrower’s assets, debtholders also care about  the liquidation  \nvalue of the  assets. Furthermore , debt is an agreement to repay the principal and interest, not the fair \nvalue. Thus debtholders may not find  the fair value reporting of liabilities helpful.  \nAccounting plays two major roles in debt markets: valuation and contracting . The valuation \nrole of accounting helps borrowers and lenders to mitigate information asymmetry by sharing \ninformation directly relevant to prici ng debt. This role requires accounting numbers to reflect \nmanagers ’ private and forward -looking information, even if it is not immediately  verifiable . In \ncontrast, under the contracting role, financial reports supply auditable financial outcome variables f or \nuse in efficient contracts with the firm. This role requires accounting numbers to be independently \nverifiable and enforceable in a court of law.  The next two subsections examine evidence in the \nliterature  related to each of these aspects.  \n6.1. Valuati on-related effects of IFRS on the debt market  \n6.1.1.  Effects  of IFRS  on firms’ capital structure  \nBased on Myers and Majluf ’s (1984) adverse -selection theory, Naranjo, Saavedra, and Verdi \n(2014) conjecture that , by reducing  information asymmetry and the attendant adverse selection costs,' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 47}
page_content='47 \n mandatory IFRS adoption enable s firms to easily raise external funds. Based on  Myers’ (1984) \npecking order theory , they surmise that  IFRS adopters with high debt capacit ies choose debt as their \nprimary source of external financing. Based on  a sample of firms covering 41 countries from 2003  \nthrough 2012 , they  find that mandatory IFRS adopters raise more external financing after adoption \nand that firms with high er debt capacit ies issue incrementally more debt than equity and have higher \nleverage ratio s in the post -adoption than firms with lower debt capacit ies. Consistent with the notion \nthat IFRS helps lower information asymmetry problems, t he observed  effects  are more pronounced \nfor firms with higher ex -ante levels of information asymmetry.  \nFlorou and Kosi (2015) investigate how IFRS adoption affect s a firm’s choice of the type of \ndebt financing, i.e. , public v ersus  private. Compared with public bondholders, private lenders , such as  \nbanks , have access to borrowers’ private information and superior information -processing abilities \nand therefore face less  of an  adverse selection problem  (Bharath, Sunder, and Sunder, 2008) . This \nimplies that firms with better reporting quality should ha ve better access to public debt relative to \nprivate debt . Testing this prediction on a sample of public bond and private loan issuances made \nbetween 2000 and 2007 , Florou and Kosi (2015) provide corroborative evidence. T hey find that \nmandatory IFRS adopter s are more likely than non-adopters  to issue public bonds  rather  than private \nloans. Like the evidence provided by  Naranjo et al. (2015), the ir findings support the prediction of \nMyers and Majluf (1984) that better information quality increases firms’ reli ance on external sources \nof financing.  Naranjo et al. (2015) and Florou and Kosi (2015) rely on the argument that IFRS \nimprove reporting quality and lower information asymmetry . However,  as discussed earlier in \nSection s 3 and  4, the evidence for this argument is mixed.  \nIFRS -related s tudies o f external financing patterns raise several questions for future research. \nIf firms raise more financing through public debt issues following IFRS adoption, then where does the \nincreased availability of funds come from? Are the  funds from non -IFRS -reporting firms  reallocated ? \nAre there changes in the money supply or multiplier effects at the macroeconomic level? Do the \ndocumented effects of IFRS on external funding differ when the  supply of capital is limited? \nAlthough  we recognize that efforts to understand the broader macro -level effects  of accounting shocks \nare not straightforward, these are issues worth pursuing.  \n6.1.2.  Effects of IFRS on the credit relevance of accounting numbers  \nIFRS  studies generally find that  the accounting information produced by IFRS is more value \nrelevant for stock market participants  (see Section 3) . This raises the natural question of whether the \nsame holds  true for debtholders. In other words, do IFRS numbers better predict a firm’s cred it risk \nthan local GAAP numbers? One may argue that IFRS numbers are more credit relevant , as IFRS \nrequire recognition of more liabilities, such as pension obligations and employee stock options, which' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 48}
page_content='48 \n under local GAAP tend to be either optional or not req uired. Furthermore , the increased emphasis on \nthe fair value measurement for financial instruments and fixed assets may result in  IFRS numbers \nreflect ing losses in a timelier manner than historical cost accounting. However , the increased \nflexibility and managerial discretion required under a principles -based IFRS regime can compromise \nthe verifiability and reliability of accounting numbers and therefore make financial statements less \nuseful for creditors.  \nSeveral studies empirica lly investigate the effect s of IFRS on credit relevance . However, t he \nresults  tend to be  mixed. Florou, Kosi, and Pope (2015) and Wu and Zhang (2014) find that IFRS \nadoption increases the credit relevance of accounting numbers, and Kraft and Landsman (2014 ) find  \nthat IFRS decrease credit relevance. Further more , Bhat, Callen, and Segal (2014) find that IFRS \nadoption has no effect on credit relevance. The se differ ing conclusions are likely driven by the \ndifferences in the researchers’  definition s of credit re levan ce and their proxies for credit risk. For \nexample, Florou et al. (2015)  measure credit relevance using R2 values from regressing S&P credit \nratings on accounting variables, and Wu and Zhang (2014) measure it using the sensitivity  of Moody’s \ncredit ratings to the accounting ratios. Bhat et al . (2014) follow a similar approach to that of Florou et \nal. (2015) but replace credit ratings with credit default swap (CDS) spreads in the ir credit -relevance \nregressions. Kraft and Landsman (2 014) also rely on CDS spreads to proxy for credit risk but focus on \nthe residuals from regressing CDS spreads on accounting ratios rather than on the R2 values, as done \nby Bhat et al. (2014).  \nThe preceding studies vary in terms of not only their methodological choices but also  their \nsamples.  Wu and Zhang (2014) examine both voluntary and mandatory IFRS adopters from 19 \ncountries between 1990 and 2007 and include  all of the countries that did not mandate IFRS  in their \ncontrol sample . They find a si gnificant increase in the credit relevance of accounting numbers for both \nvoluntary and mandatory adopters but only for firms domiciled in countries with strong rule s of law. \nIn contrast, Florou et al .

However,  even within these three studies, the number of countries covered by their \ntreatment  samples vary: Florou et al .

However,  no such changes are observed  in the \ncontrol sample , suggest ing that IFRS adoption increase s transparency within the debt markets.  \nOverall, the mixed results obtained from these studies preclude draw ing strong inferences \nabout  the effect s of IFRS on credit assessment. More research is needed to reconcile the m. Future \nresearch should also attempt to highlight the precise mechanisms and  pinpoint the specific accounting \nrules that affect the credit relevance of IFRS numbers.  \n6.1.3.  Effects of IFRS on  the cost of debt  \nBorrowers’ financial reporting quality can affect their cost s of debt in several ways. First, \nSengupta (1998) argues that lenders and underwriters demand lower risk premium s associated with \nthe potential withholding of adverse private information for firms with better disclosure quality.  \nSecond, as discussed in Sect ion 4.4.1, several theories predict that poor reporting quality increases \npriced information risk and thus a firm’s cost of capital, including the cost of debt.41 Finally, Zhang \n(2008) argues that timely loss recognition (or conditional conservatism) in fin ancial reports better \nprotects lenders’ interests by triggering debt covenants early upon signs of financial distress and thus \neffectively restricts borrowers’ ability to distribute assets as dividends or otherwise squander assets. \nConsequently, she conjec tures that investors are willing to accept a lower rate of return for lending to \nfirms that report losses in a timel ier manner.   \nBased on the assumption that , from a debt holder’ s perspective , financial reports under IFRS \nare of a higher quality than those prepared under local GAAP , Kim, Tsui, and Yi (2011) suggest that \nIFRS adoption decreases the  ex-ante information risk faced by lenders  and ex-post monitoring and re -\ncontracting costs.  They also note that IFRS adoption can improve  the coordination bet ween lenders \nand borrowers in relation  to capital investment decisions. Based on  these potential benefits, Kim et al. \n(2011)  contend that voluntary IFRS adopters should face a lower cost of debt  and test this prediction \non a sample of syndicated loans issu ed between 1997 and 2005 across 40 countries . They find that \nIFRS adopters pay lower interest rates, have loans with longer maturit ies, raise  larger loan amounts , \nare less likely to have restrictive covenants , and attract more foreign lenders  than non -IFRS adopters.  \n                                                            \n40 In Duffie and Lando’s (2001) model, the transparency of the accounting system is specifically characterized \nas the variance of the noise in asset values, which directly affects creditors’ ability to estimate the probability of \ndefault. Bhat et al. (2015) empirically measure transparency using analyst forecast dispersion and error.  \n41 For US stocks, Francis et al. (2005) and Bharath, Sunder, and Sunder (2008) provide evidence of a negative \nrelation ship between reporting quality  and the cost of debt using accrual quality as a proxy for reporting quality.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 50}
page_content='50 \n However, only  the results for lower interest rates and larger loan amounts are robust to controls for \nthe endogeneity biases arising from firms self -selecting to adopt IFRS . \nIn contrast to the  preceding  findings for voluntary adopt ers, Chen, Chin, Wang, and Yao \n(2015) study the effects of mandatory IFRS adoption on the properties of syndicated loans . They \nargue  that mandating IFRS can either increase or decrease information asymmetry between lenders \nand borrowers , depending on wheth er debtholders view the  IFRS as being of better quality than the \nlocal GAAP.  Based on analysis of syndicated bank loans issued between 2000 and 2011 by firms \nfrom 31 countries that mandatorily adopted IFRS, they find that interest rates increase d by 24 basis \npoints  and loan maturities decrease d by one month  for IFRS adopters relative to the corresponding \nchanges for non -adopters. They also find that the borrowers experiencing greater effects  from IFRS \nadoption (measured as a score of the total number of restated financial statement items in the \ntransition year or as the inverse of  the change in variance of abnormal accruals from the pre- to post -\nadoption period s) faced higher interest rates  and larger declines in loan maturity . These results help \nbetter l ink their findings to IFRS adoption.  \nExtending the analysis to compare the effects of IFRS on public bond terms with those on \nprivate loan terms, Florou and Kosi (2015) find that interest rates are lower for public bonds issued \nafter mandatory IFRS adopti on but not for private loans. They attribute this finding to IFRS adoption \nimproving the quality of the public  information , which bond holders rely  on more , as, unlike banks \nand other private lenders , they do not have  private channels of communicat ion with borrowers.  \nOverall , like the evidence for the effects of IFRS on  the credit relevance of accounting \nnumbers, the evidence for the effects of IFRS on debt contract terms is mixed.  There are several \npotential explanations for the differences in the conclusions derived by these studies. First, analysis of \nvoluntary adopters is open to endogeneity concerns and the effects on mandatory adopters may be \naffected by contaminating events.  Second, even within  the studies focusing on mandatory IFRS \nadoption , there are differences across  the sample selection  choices . Although both Florou and Kosi \n(2015) and Chen et al. (2015) use DealScan as their data source for the private loan sample, the \nformer have a shorter sample period and a more restricted sample selec tion process.42 As a result,  \nFlorou and Kosi (2015)  may have less  power ful tests  to explain the lack of significant increases in \ninterest rates observed for private loan contracts . It is equally possible that the more homogenous \nsample of firms and greater number of  control variables  used by Florou and Kosi (2015) yield cleaner \nresults.43 Finally, the average effects observed in the various studies may be  affected by specific \n                                                            \n42 Florou and Kosi (2015) limit their sample period to years before 2008 to avoid the financial crisis period . \nChen et al. (2015) end their sample period in 2011. In addition, Florou and Kosi (2015) limit their sample to \nsenior term loans, revolvers, and 364 -day facilities.  \n43 In Florou and Kosi ’s (2015)  study , the indicator variable for mandatory IFRS adoption has a positive but \ninsignificant coefficient in most of their regres sions on the cost of private loans.

Although no evidence exists in  the debt markets, it is not \nunreasonable to expect enforcement and adoption incentives to cause cross -country variation s in IFRS \neffects.  \nBy focusing on firms that issue debt to measure the cost of debt, the preceding  studies are \nimplicitly conditioned on the decision to i ssue debt. However, as we discuss in Section 6.1.1, IFRS \nmay affect firms’ decision s to issue debt and to issue public versus private debt. Thus, ideally \nspeaking, the decision to issue debt, the type of debt (public or private) , and the debt features shou ld \nbe modeled together and simultaneously estimated. That task poses significant econometric \nchallenges.  \nFollowing an argument similar to that seen in  the preceding  studies , i.e.,  that IFRS improve \nthe transparency and creditworthiness of borrowers, Chan, Hsu, and Lee (2013) predict that IFRS \nadoption should yield higher credit ratings, as investors and credit analysts account  for improved \nreporting quality when forming their credit ratings. Using a samp le of foreign firms cross -listed in the \nUS that mandatorily adopted IFRS in 2005, Chan et al. (2013) find a significant increase in the sample \nfirms’ credit ratings after adoption relative to their US -domiciled counterparts and relative to a control \nsample  of foreign firms cross -listed in the US but not subject to  the IFRS mandate.  Although  their \nfindings corroborate those of Kim et al. (2011), focusing on firms that voluntarily cross -list in the US \nintroduces its own self -selection biases, as these firms f ace unique incentives and are unlikely to \nrepresent the population.  \nDonelson, Jennings, and McInnis (2015) survey a sample of commercial banks in terms of  \ntheir use of accounting information in making lending decisions. Although their survey mainly relates  \nto US banks lending  to private companies, their findings may illuminate how accounting choices and \nstandards affect debt market decisions  more generally . Their evidence indicates  that lenders are much \nmore likely to require more collateral and guarantee s from borrowers with poor reporting quality \nrather than increasing interest rates. This finding contradict s the effect s of interest rate s documented in \nrelation to  IFRS adoption. Similar surveys conducted in countries that  have  adopted IFRS may \nprovide further insights into the relevance of IFRS  for lending decisions.  \nLamoreaux, Michas, and Schultz (2015) provide evidence o f the role of  IFRS in lending by \nthe World Bank to developing economies in the form of international development aid.  The aut hors \npoint out that the World Bank relies on  audited financial statements to monitor  the projects  funded \nthrough its loans and claim that higher accounting quality in a country can help decreas e monitoring \ncosts . Using a sample of 258 country -year observations from 42 countries between 1999  and 2008,  the \n                                                                                                                                                                                         \nsample has 8,628 observations versus the 11,238 observations included by  Chen et al. (2015) for the same  \nperiod, i.e. , 2000 –2007. In addition, Florou and Kosi’s (2015) regression models include v ariables measuring \ndefault risk, such as O -score and distance to default, which load significantly.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 52}
page_content='52 \n authors find that  the World Bank lends more to  countries where fewer differences exist between local \nGAAP and IAS ( e.g., Bae et al. , 2008 ) and those that mandate IFRS, indicating that accounting \nquality plays a role in the allocation of international aid loans. However, accounting quality fails to \nplay a role in the allocation decision for countries that are more closely aligned with US geopolitical \ninterests.   \n6.2. Effects of IFRS on contractibility in the debt market s \nAs an accounting system provides timely and verifiable performance measures that indicate \nthe underlying creditworthiness  of borrowers , accounting numbers are often used in debt covenants to \nrestrict managerial a ctions that harm debtholders and act as tripwires that give lenders an option to \nrenegotiate debt terms following a decline in a borrowers ’ economic performance (Smith and Warner \n1979). In fact, based on the finding that little new information is released upon  earnings \nannouncements to market participants, Ball and Shivakumar (2008) conclude that a major role of \naccounting numbers must be their use in contract s, such as debt settlement and compensation \ncontracts (Watts and Zimmerman 1986) and in disciplining prior information released by managers \n(Gigler and Hemmer 1998; Ball 2001; Ball, Jayaraman , and Shivakumar 2012). However,  the extent \nto which accounting numbers matter for inclusion in debt covenants ultimately depends on the ability \nof accou nting numbers to accurately predict changes in a borrower’s credit risks, particularly before \nthe material deterioration of its creditworthiness.    \nThe literature provides good reasons to expect IFRS adoption to either increase or decrease \nthe use of accou nting numbers in debt covenants. Ball et al. (2015) argue that the increased \nmanagerial flexibility available under  principles -based IFRS a s well as  greater  emphasis on fair -value \naccounting  decrease s the relevance  of IFRS  numbers for use in debt contracts .44 In contrast , \nDemerjian (2012) presents a model that suggests that IFRS adoption , by improving financial \ntransparency,  would lower the need for all types ( both accounting and non -accounting -based ) of debt \ncovenants . In his model, covenants are tripwires for renegotiation s and are needed for borrowers and \nlenders to initially contract  on limited and potentially asymmetric information.  \nKim et al. (2011) study changes in covenant usage around voluntary IFRS adoptions and \ndocument that IFRS adopters are less likely to have restrictive covenants. They attribute this to the \ngreater transparency accorded by IFRS  reporting , as implied by Demerjian (2012) , and conclude that \n                                                            \n44 Ball et al. (2015) provide the following reasons for why fair value emphasis lowers the relevance of IFRS \nnumbers for inclusion in debt contracts . First,  fair value gains and losses from shocks to the cash flows  of assets  \nare transitory, making current -period earnings a poorer predictor of future debt service capacity.  Second, f air \nvalue gains and losses include shocks to  the expected returns  of assets. T o the extent that these shocks are \nexpected to reverse before debt maturity, they are irrelevant for debt contracting. Third, as  debt contracts require \nrepayment of the principal and interest  and not the fair value  of the debt , the IFRS option to fair value certain \nfinancial liabilities lowers the contracting value.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 53}
page_content='53 \n a lower likelihood of restrictive covenants is an important benefit of IFRS adoption. Chen et al. \n(2015) study covenant usage changes after mandatory IFRS adoption and , like Kim et al. (2011) , \ndocument declines in covenant usage after adoption. However, in contrast to Kim et al. (2011), they \nattribute the decline in covenant usage to IFRS w orsening the accounting quality of at least some \nfirms.  \nThe studies by Kim et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2015) are subject to a common data \nproblem: they treat debt contracts without covenant information as having zero covenants. However, \nas covenant -free loans are rare, particularly in Europe  before 2010 , the covenant -free observations are \nmore likely to represent cases where data vendors have not collected pertinent information  (Ball et al. , \n2015). Therefore  it is probably  inappropriate  to treat observations with missing covenant information \nas covenant -free, as done in these studies.  \nBall et al. (2015) also study the effect of mandatory IFRS adoption on covenant usage in debt \ncontracts. However, in contrast to Kim et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2 015), they consider accounting - \nand non -accounting -based covenants  separately  and study whether IFRS adoption leads to a \nsubstitution effect between the two . Moreover, they study the effect s of IFRS on covenants for both \npublic bonds and private loans.  Using a sample of new loans and bonds issued between 2001 and \n2010 in 22 IFRS -adopting countries and 21 non -IFRS -adopting  countries, Ball et al. (2015) document \na significant decline in the usage of accounting covenants in both loan and bond contracts followi ng \nIFRS adoption. At the same time, they find that firms increase their reliance on non -accounting \ncovenants. This latter result is not consistent with the argument that IFRS improv e financial \ntransparency. The  authors  conclude that their results support  IFRS decreasing the contractibility of \naccounting.  \nAlthough  the findings of Ball et al. (2015) provide evidence of how IFRS adoption may affect \ncovenant usage, it is unclear whether their results identify permanent changes in borrowers and \nlenders’ use of  accounting numbers for debt contracts or whether these are temporary effects observed \nwhile borrowers and lenders adapt to new accounting standards. Moreover, as IFRS adoption change s \nfinancial reporting in many ways simultaneously, the  authors  cannot trace the decline in accounting \ncovenant us age to individual IFRS attributes, although their cross -sectional results for banks are \nconsistent with the observation that fair-value accounting play s a role in the decreased  reliance on \naccounting covenants.  \nChris tensen, Lee , and Walker (2009) study the consequences of IFRS adoption for debt \ncovenant violations.  They argue that IFRS adoption can mechanically trip debt covenants by changing \nhow earnings are calculated. Relying on the magnitude of IFRS reconciliation s as a proxy for \nmechanical covenant violations and assuming that these covenant violations transfer wealth from' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 54}
page_content='54 \n shareholders to debt  holders, they predict that stock market reactions relate positively to IFRS \nreconciliation numbers, i.e., the difference between net income based on IFRS and that based on \ndomestic GAAP. They test this prediction on a sample of 137 UK firms by analyzing the stock market \nreactions to announcements of IFRS reconci liation numbers in the year before  mandatory IFRS \nadoption  in the UK . Consistent with their predictions, they document a significantly positive \nrelation ship between IFRS reconciliation numbers and earnings announcement returns. This \nrelationship is also pr onounced for firms that are more likely to violate covenants or face greater costs \nof covenant violation, such as small firms, firms with lower interest coverage ratio s, and firms  with \nlonger asset maturit ies. Horton and Serafeim (2010) also report a posit ive association between IFRS \nreconciliation numbers and earnings announcement returns and document that this relation ship is \nprimarily driven by adjustments pertaining to goodwill and deferred taxes.  \nResearch related to the effects of  IFRS on accounting  contractibility  is nascent . The \nrelation ship between IFRS accounting attributes and the use of IFRS numbers in debt contracts and \nother contracts (such as supplier or customer contracts)  requires more research . The l ack of \ncomprehensive and detailed contract  data, including covenant  data, in a cross -country setting is a n \nobstacle for such research. Although  companies in the US are required to file their debt contracts with \nthe SEC, such requirements are not common elsewhere , especially for private contracts and loans.  As \na result , data vendors must rely on private sources or surveys to gather contractual information in an \ninternational context.  Consistent with this, Ball et al. (2015) note that only 10% of international debt \nissues have at least one (accounti ng or non -accounting) recorded covenant and that this probably  \nrepresents the failure or inability of vendors to collect covenant information rather than the debt being \ncovenant  free. Language barriers also make it harder for researchers to compile a meani ngful ly sized \ninternational dataset with detailed contract information. Such data limitations restrict researchers’ \nability to address  basic contracting  issue s, such as  the ability to contract around specific attributes of \nIFRS.  \nFurther research is also n eeded to explore several other issues surrounding  the use of IFRS \nnumbers in debt contracting, including whether and how public bond and syndicated loan contracts \ndiffer in their use of IFRS numbers, whether lenders use more credit -rating -based performance -\npricing provisions when accounting systems are weak, and how the use of IFRS numbers in debt \ncontracts is affected by the quality of enforcement in a country. However, the effect of reporting \nenforcement for contractibility in debt markets  may not be straightforward . Strong enforcement may \nmitigate the opportunistic use of flexibility in reporting and thus increase  the usefulness of \naccounting.  However, it  may also require borrowers to implement fair value accounting , and to the \nextent that  fair values are less relevant  for debt contracting , stronger enforcement may actually \ndecrease the  use of accounting -based covenants .' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 55}
page_content='55 \n Another promising area for research is to examine how debt market characteristics affect \nfirms’ choice of accounting poli cies under IFRS. IFRS is often considered  as a principles -based \nstandard  that give managers discretion over both the ir accounting choices and implementation of \nspecific standards.  This increased flexibility may allow managers to opportunistically manage \nearnings to obtain better  debt contracting terms or avoid covenant violation s. Several studies \ndocument such behavior in the US (e.g., Beatty and Weber  2003 ; Altamuro, Beatty, and Weber  2005 ).  \nHowever, similar evidence in the IFRS context is largel y unavailable . One exception is a study by \nChristensen and Nikolaev (2013) , who examine how firms’ reliance on debt  financing affects their \nchoice between historical  cost accounting and fair  value accounting under IFRS , i.e. , the  cost or \nrevaluation model under IAS 16 . They argue that debtholders may prefer either the historical  cost model  \n(due to its greater degree of verifiability ) or the revaluation model (for the purpose  of obtaining the \ncurrent values of collateral assets ) and document the very limited use of the revaluation model  for long -\nterm assets by UK and German firms .  \n \n7. Effects of IFRS on stewardship and corporate governance  \nMany view the stewardship role in mitigating agency -principal conflicts as a key objective of \nfinancial reporting , in addition to the objective of providing information useful for decision making . A \nnotable change in the IFRS  framework  is its exclusion of the stewardship role as an explicit goal of \nfinancial reporting, along with the claim that decision  usefulness subsumes the stewardship role.  \nAlthough decision  usefulness could be broadly defined to include  stewardship, a number of \nauthors argue that the overl ap between these objectives is incomplete and that the investment -related  \nroles and stewardship roles for financial statements differ in terms of  their needs  for specific reporting \nattributes (Gjesdal, 1981). For example, Bushman and Indjejikian (1993) demonstrate that , when \nmanagers must  be provided with different incentives for different activities, the inability to contract \non activity -level outcomes makes biased aggregate accounting information desirable for \ncompensation contracts. The bias enables varying weightings across individual activities in the \ncompensation contracts. Further focusing on timely recognition of gains and losses , Shivakumar \n(2013) reviews a variety of reasons why the timely recognition of losses, but not gains, is more \nbeneficial from the contracting and stewardship perspective s, even though timely recognition of both \ngains and losses  is useful  from a valuation perspective .45 \n                                                            \n45 Timely loss recognition removes incentives for managers to continue loss -making projects and invest in new \nunprofitable projects, particularly when the negative consequences of such projects wi ll be unknown to outsiders \nfor long periods.  However , such concerns do not arise for managers continuing profit -making projects. \nFurthermore , conditionally conservative reporting can aid outside directors by attenuating managerial biases to' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 56}
page_content='56 \n We discuss several  studies that investigat e the effect of IFRS adoption on stewardship and \ncompensation.  In the following subsection, we discuss studies that focus on how IFRS adoption \ninfluences the use of accounting numbers in compensation contracts that are aimed  at mitigating \nmanager -shareholder incentive conflicts.  Section 7.2 discuss es studies pertaining to  the influence of \nIFRS on  the effectiveness of managerial monitoring.  As there are significant gaps in the IFRS \nliterature pertaining to the stewardship role of financial numbers, we dedicate a separate subsection \n(Section 7.3) to discuss ing these gaps , which future research must  fill. \n7.1. Effects  of IFRS  on executive compensation  \n7.1.1. Empirical predictions o f the effect of reporting quality on executiv e compensation  \nA large literature examines the role of accounting in aligning  the incentives of managers and \nshareholders by studying the use of accounting numbers in executive compensation plans.46 There are \na variety of ways that IFRS matter for  compensation plans.  \nFirst, as IFRS improve earnings comparability across peer firms , as discussed in Section 3.3, \nIFRS adoption makes accounting -based relative performance evaluation (RPE) more efficient. \nSecond,  as IFRS earnings are more value relevant and reflect economic gains and losses in a timelier \nmanner than local GAAP earnings due to their fair value emphasis, IFRS may induce firms to increase \ntheir reliance on earnings for compensation purposes . If compensation committees consider \naccounting earnings under IFRS as a better measure of underlying economic performance, then we \nwould expect them to optimally increase the weight placed on accounting earnings in determining \nexecutive compensation and turn over. Such a finding would be consistent with the arguments of \nHolmst rom (1979 ) and Banker and Datar (1989), who suggest that the weight placed on a \nperformance signal should increase with its precision and sensitivity to an agent’s effort. This view \nhas f ound empirical support in the US, where Banker, Huang, and Natarajan (2009) show that \ncompensation contracts place more weight on earnings when  earnings are more value relevant. \nFurthermore , Bushman, Chen, Engel, and Smith (2004) find that executive compen sation packages in \nthe US include a higher proportion of equity -based incentives when the timeliness of the earnings is \nlower.  \nHowever, several features of IFRS also make accounting -based performance measures less \nefficient to address stewardship issues. First, the greater discretion afforded to managers under \nprinciples -based IFRS  can raise concerns about the independent verifiability of the reported numbers , \nan important attribute of accounting numbers for their use in stewardship and contracting. On a \n                                                                                                                                                                                         \nreport favorably.  Finally, timely recognition of gains involves greater managerial subjectivity and lower \nverifiability, which lowers demand for contracting and stewardship purposes.  \n46 See studies by Bushman and Smith (2001), Armstrong, Guay, and Weber (2010), an d Shivakumar (2013) for \nreviews.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 57}
page_content='57 \n related point , IFRS offer a greater choice of accounting policies , which increases the potential for \nmanipulation of reported numbers. These concerns can lead boards to rely less on accounting numbers \nin compensation contracts .47 Such concerns  may also affect equity -based executive compensation , as \nstock prices  may also be affected by such manipulation . Studies document evidence consistent with \nopportunistic earnings management  to enhance equity compensation in the US context (e.g., \nBergstresser and Phil ippon 2006 ; Burns and Kedia 2006).  \nSecond, the greater use of fair value s under IFRS lowers the distinction between the role of \nearnings and that of share prices in compensation contracts. Although stock price has many \nadvantages as an incentive measure, it does not provide a sufficiently precise signal of managerial \neffort and ability. For instance,  Paul (1992) analytically shows that stock -based compensation \ncontracts assign the greatest weight to projects that are the noisiest indicators of managerial effort, if \nstock market investors observe information about all of the projects in a firm with equ al precision. \nThis occurs because  the projects most affected by noise are likely to produce extreme values and \naffect share prices the most. Moreover, share prices are affected by a variety of factors that are beyond \na manager’s control, such as investor s entiment and macroeconomic factors.48 Sloan (1993) \nemphasizes this point by noting that accounting data can be incrementally useful to stock price in \ncompensation contracts , as it can identify the component of stock price that is under a manager’s \ncontrol. Supporting these points, Bushman and Indjejikian (1993) analytically show that the \ninformation content of earnings influences the optimal design of contracts that compensate managers \nbased on earnings and share prices. The findings of these studies , when c ombined with the effect of \nIFRS on earnings (making them  closer to stock price measures of performance), suggest that earnings \nnumbers under IFRS lose some of their advantage relative to stock price s for use in compensation \ncontracts.  \n7.1.2. Empirical evid ence o f the effects of  IFRS on compensation contracts  \nOzkan, Singer, and You (2012) examine the effect of mandatory IFRS adoption on the usage \nof accounting -based performance measures in executive compensation contracts. They focus on two \naspects: pay  performance  sensitivity (PPS) and RPE. They base t heir study on a sample of 892 public \nfirms covering 15 continental European countries that mandatorily adopted IFRS in 2005.  They \nrestrict their focus to these countries , arguing that firms in these countri es are more comparable and \nthus more likely to use RPE in compensation contracts. They conjecture that , if compensation \ncommittees consider  earnings as higher quality after IFRS adoption, then one should observe an \n                                                            \n47 For example, Indjejikian and Matejka (2009) find a decrease in the reliance of CFO bonus contracts on \nfinancial performance after SOX and attribute this finding to firms’ wanting to decreas e CFOs ’ incentives to \nmisreport.   \n48 Although Paul (1992) predicts  that the valuation role of earnings is independent of the managerial -incentive \ncontracting role of earnings, Bushman, Engel , and Smith (2006) and Banker et al. (2009) extend the analysis  and \nshow empirical ly that earnings can play a role in both valuation and compensation contracts simultaneously.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 58}

Analy zing \nthe cash compensation received by top executives from these firms  from 2002  through 2008, Ozkan et \nal. (2012) document a weak increase in the use of  accounting -based PPS and a significant increase in \nthe use of accounting -based  performance of foreign peers for RPE  after IFRS adoption . At the same \ntime, they find no change  in the use of stock -return -based  PPS or RPE for stock -based compensation . \nThey also link the increase in accounting -based  RPE to greater earnings comparability  by \ndocumenting that the effect is stronger among firms with greater foreign sales and those with fewer \ncomparable domestic peers . \nAlthough  Ozkan et al. (2012) infer  the effects of IFRS by  evaluating the sensitivity of \nexecutive compensation to accounting numbers, Voulgaris , Stathopoulos , and Walker  (2014) directly \nexamine contractual terms to identify whether long -term incentive -based executive pay is based on \naccounting targets, stock return targets, or both. Thus, although  prior studies can comment only on the \ninformational relevance of accounting numbers from a compensation perspective, Voulgaris et al. \n(2014) can clearly identify  the changes caused by IFRS to the use of accounting numbers to measure \nmanagerial performance. However , this approach is limited; the authors  do not observe the levels at \nwhich performance targets are set or how compensation committees combine various performance \nmeasures in arriving at  executive compensation, so they cannot  evaluate how IFRS  adoption affects \nthe amount of compensation. For instance, although they can identify the use of earnings numbers in a \ncompensation contract, they cannot distinguish between a contract in which  most of a CEO’s bonus is \ntied to earnings and one in which  very little of the bonus is tied to earnings.  \nIn contrast to Ozkan et al. (2012), Voulgaris et al. (2014) find a decrease in the usage of \nearnings -based performance measures after mandatory IFRS adoption for a sample of UK CEO \ncompensation contracts. In line with our earlier discussions, they attribute these findings to the greater \nfair value orientation of IFRS relative to local UK GAAP . Consistent with this, they show that the \npost-IFRS decline in the use of accounting numbers is greater in financial industr ies, where fair  value \naccounting typically has a larger effect on reported earnings numbers.  \nAlthough  the difference in research methodologies between  Ozkan et al. (2012) and Voulgaris \net al. (2014) is one reason for the differences in their results, there are indications that sample \ndifference may  partly reconcile the findings . Based on cross -country analysis, Ozkan et al. (2012) find \nthat their results hold only for countries whose prior domestic GAAP differed substantia lly from \nIFRS. In contrast, for countries such as the UK  where the differences between local GAAP and IFRS \nare relatively small, the relation ship is negative , though insignificant. The focus of Voulgaris et al. \n(2014) on a more homogenous sample may explai n the significantly negative effects of IFRS on the' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 59}

Hence its results may be  \ndriven by contaminated events, such as the more equity -intensive pay structures adopted by European \nfirms in the 2000s (Fernandes, Ferreria, Matos, and Murphy 2012).  \n \n7.2. Effect s of IFRS on the role of accounting in managerial monitoring  \nA relatively lar ge number of US-based studies evaluate the role of accounting numbers in the \nefficient monitoring of managers . For instance, Engel, Hayes, and Wang (2003) show that boards of \ndirectors rely on both earnings and stock prices to monitor managerial performanc e, suggesting a role \nfor reporting quality in effective corporate governance. To the extent that IFRS adoption has \nimproved corporate transparency and information asymmetry, one may expect  managerial monitoring  \npractices  to use accounting numbers to become more effective and corporate governance mechanisms  \nto increase their reliance on financial reports in the post -IFRS -adoption period .  \nMarra and Mazzola (2014) and Marra, Mazzola, and Prencipe (2011) study  the effect of IFRS \nadoption on boards ’ effectiveness in constraining earnings management. Marra et al . (2011) examine \na sample of 222 Italian firms that mandatorily adopted IFRS in 2005 and find that the relation ship \nbetween board characteristics —such as , board independence and the presence of an audit \ncommitte e—and earnings management  became  more negative  in the post -adoption (2005 –2006)  \nperiod  relative to the pre -adoption period (2003 –2004).  They interpret their findings to indicat e that \nIFRS facilitat e board monitoring . However,  in a follow -up study, Marra and Mazzola (2014) point out \nthat the findings of Marra et al . (2011) are driven by a temporarily higher level of attention that boards \npaid to accounting issues at the time of transitioning to IFRS . Consistent with this argument, they \nshow that the negative association between board independence and earnings management was \nstrongest in 2005, the adoption year , and then gradually decrease d in later years (2006 and 2007).  \nUsing the voting premium associ ated with dual -class shares as a proxy for the effectiveness of \nmanagerial monitoring, Hong (2013) examines whether mandatory IFRS adoption changes the voting \npremium. She argues that  the voting premium is lowered when corporate transparency is improved, a s \ngreater transparency improves managerial monitoring and lowers the benefits of voting control.  \nComparing a sample of 133 firms in IFRS -adopting countries that have dual -class shares with firms \nfrom non -adopting countries that have dual -class shares, she  documents a significant decrease in \nvoting premiums for firms in IFRS -adopting countries after mandatory adoption. The study’s reliance \non a difference -in-difference s methodology helps it to more clearly attribute the observed changes to \nthe IFRS  adoption  date. However, the  study’s  small sample limits it from conducting more focused' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 60}

Reporting \nquality affects the effectiveness of this corporate governance mechanism, as financial statements are a \nkey source of information for making takeover -related decisions ( Raman et al. 2012) . Consistent with \nthis view, Francis, Huang , and Khurana (2012) and Louis and Urcan (2014) show  that the mandatory \nadoption of IFRS has increased cross -border M&A between  countries with lower degree s of similarity \nin their domestic GAAP during  the pre -IFRS period.  \nFocusing on  CEO turnover as an outcome variable of managerial monitoring , Wu and Zhang \n(2009) examine how the voluntary adoption of IAS and US GAAP affect s the use of  accounting -based \nmeasure s in turnover. Based on the assertion that earnings informativeness is higher under US GAAP \nand IAS than under domestic GAAP in EU countries, the y argue that IAS/US  GAAP  adoption should \nincrease the reliance of internal performance evaluation on accounting earnings  and consequently \nincrease  the sensitivity of CEO turnover to earnings. Using a sample of continental European firms \nthat voluntarily adopted either IAS or US GAAP betwe en 1988 and 2004 , in addition to  hand -\ncollected data related to  CEO turnover, t hey find evidence consistent with the preceding  prediction .49  \nDue to the endogenous feature of firms’ voluntary adoption decision, the authors are careful not to  \nmake  any causal claim about  the relation ship between IAS/US GAAP  adoption and changes  in \nearnings  performance  sensitivity . As the study pools voluntary IAS and US GAAP adopters together, \nit is difficult to judge whether the results are mainly driven by IAS adoption, US GAAP adoption, or \nboth.  \nWu and Zhang (2011) study the relevance of accounti ng earnings in RPE for CEO turnover \ndecisions  after mandatory IFRS adoption . They find that mandatory IFRS adoption in continental \nEurope has led to an increased reliance on foreign peer s’ earnings for CEO turnover  decisions . This \nevidence corroborates the  argument of Ozkan et al. (2012) that IFRS improve cross -country \ncomparisons of accounting earnings for relative performance evaluation.  \nIn contrast to the  preceding  studies , which  focus on how IFRS  adoption affects corporate \ngovernance, Verriest, Gaeremynck, and Thornton (2013) take the opposite tack and examine the \neffect of corporate governance on the firm -level enforcement of IFRS adoption. They find that firms \nwith stronger governance provide more transparent restatements from local GAAP to IFR S, achieve \nbetter compliance, and are less likely to opportunistically delay the adoption of IAS 39. This study ’s \nfindings of firm -level heterogeneity in  the enforcement of IFRS adoption are useful for researchers to \n                                                            \n49 In addition, Wu and Zhang (2009) examine the sensitivity of employee layoffs to accounting earnings after \nvoluntary IAS adoption and find results consistent with those for CEO t urnover.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 61}
page_content='61 \n extend their reporting enforcement prox ies to the firm level, rather than rely only on country -level \nenforcement indices. Along similar lines,  focusing on  the audit committee as a corporate governance \nmechanism, Chen and Zhang (2010) examine how the incentives of audit committee members affect \nreported IFRS numbers. Based on  a sample of 103 Chinese B -share companies from 1999 to 2004, \nthey document that the  incentives  of audit committee s, along with regulatory enforcement, are the key \ndrivers narrowin g the differences between financial numbers reported under Chinese GAAP and those \nreported under Chinese equivalents of IFRS.  \n7.3. Limitations  and suggestions for future research  \nA major limitation of IFRS  studies focusing on stewardship is that the y do not pinpoint  the \nmechanisms through which IFRS adoption affects stewardship or identify the specific accounting \nattributes that drive these changes . Another  common problem associated with IFRS studies focused \non stewardship is their inability to find a sub stitution effect among accounting - and non-accounting -\nbased  performance measures. Theories suggest that an improvement in  the “signal -to-noise” ratio of \nearnings after IFRS adoption should lead to a greater relative weighting of earnings in managerial \nmonitoring and compensation . If so, one should equally observe a corresponding shift away from \nother performance measures, such as market -based performance measures , emphasized in the pre -\nIFRS period. Such a shift has been documented by empirical studies conducted in the US. For \nexample, Lambert and Larcker (1987) and Engel et al . (2003) document a substitution between \naccounting - and market -based performance measures.  The lack of such evidence surround ing IFRS \nadoption raises questions about whether the ob served effects can be attributed to the adoption of IFRS \nthemselves.  \nSeveral interesting questions remain unanswered as to  the effects of IFRS on compensation \ncontracts and corporate governance. Do firms modify compensation contracts to undo any effects of  \nIFRS? If so, which IFRS attributes are often adjusted? How do frequent changes to standards under \nIFRS affect the stewardship role of accounting numbers?  \nStudies must  evaluate whether and how  optimal governance structures have been affected by \nIFRS adoption.  Bushman et al. (2004) argue that , when a firm’s accounting system fails to capture \neconomic transactions in a timely manner, the firm opt s for costlier monitoring mechanisms, such as \nhirin g more outside and reputed directors.  Bushman et al. (2004) also surmise that the optimal level of \nownership concentration and stock ownership by inside directors is higher and the timeliness of \nearnings  is lower when the  decreased  transparency of financia l reports exacerbate s agency problems.  \nThe need to mitigate the agency problems shifts the optimal ownership structure toward greater stock \nholdings by owner -managers. These issues remain unexplored in the IFRS context.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 62}
page_content='62 \n Finally, firms in different legal re gimes rely on different corporate governance models. Those \nin common -law countries such as the US and UK use a shareholder governance model and rely on \npublic disclosure to resolve agency problems. In contrast, firms in code -law countries such as \nGermany a nd Italy use a stakeholder governance model , and information asymmetry is often resolved \nthrough private communications.  To the extent that IAS/IFRS can be viewed as  having a stronger  \ncommon -law orientation or a stronger  shareholder focus , it would be interesting to explore whether \nmandating IFRS rules within code -law countries lead s to shifts in firms’ corporate governance \nstructure toward a shareholder -governance model.  \n \n8. Effects of IFRS on audit verification  \nRecognizing the importance of enforcement, the “IAS Regulation” introducing mandatory \nIFRS reporting in the EU (EC Regulation 1606/2002) explicitly states that “a proper and rigorous \nenforcement regime is key to underpinning investors’ confidence in financ ial markets” and requires \nthat countries take appropriate measures to ensure compliance. To facilitate a uniform enforcement of \nIFRS in the EU member states, the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) issued a \nstandard addressing  a common appro ach to the enforcement of standards of financial information in \nEurope (CESR, 2003a). The standard contains 21 high -level principles of enforcement that member \nstates should adopt in enforcing IFRS. In response, many EU countries implemented significant \nchanges to their enforcement regimes and regulatory institutions.50 Turning specifically to the audit \nfunction, the International Audit ing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) issued additional \nguidance for the audit ing of IFRS financial statements (IAASB, 2 003).  In this section, we review the \nevidence related to the  effectiveness of these regulations with a particular focus on the audit function \nin mandatory IFRS  adoption .   \n8.1. Empirical predictions o f the effects of  IFRS on audit verification  \nResearchers suggest that a decreased  emphasis on verifiability as a key concept in the \ndevelopment of IFRS has led to less specific and less prescriptive guidance and hence increased \nsubjectivity in accounting measurement (Jamal et al. 20 10), which consequently increa se audit risks. \nFurther more , studies  point out that principles -based IFRS standards can exacerbate litigation risks for \nauditors, as they are no longer able to rely on compliance with specific guidelines or established rules \nas a valid defense  (Diehl, 2010 ). The reliance on fair value measurement under  IFRS also increases \nthe effort required of auditors, especially in  the verification of fair values of assets that do not have \nactive markets , such as specialized receivables or privately placed loans. Finally, the greater \n                                                            \n50 Christensen et al. (2013, Appendix A) provide a detailed discussion of enforcement changes within the EU .' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 63}
page_content='63 \n discretion available to managers under IFRS also increases the effort required on behalf of auditors to \nverif y IFRS -based financial statements.  \nThe increased disclosure requirements of  IFRS relative to many domestic GAAP also \nsignificantly affect  the audit function, as auditors must now sign off on more financial information \nincluding  management’s  subjective forecasts and assessme nts of assets and liabilities . For instance, \nthe increase d reporting requirements for transactions designated as accounting hedges call for \ncompanies to undertake and document detailed tests of hedge effectiveness. Furthermore, the IFRS \nprovisions relating to share -based payments require substantial disclosure a s to the nature and method \nof executive compensation plans, along with detailed information about the  inputs of fair value \ncalculations. As a result  of these additional disclosures, IFRS adoption has increased the length of \nannual reports by up to 60 % (Web b 2006; Ernst & Young 2005).  \nThe general uncertainty around the introduction of IFRS may also play  a contributing role in \nthe increased compliance and audit costs faced by firms.  Uncertainty about the implementation and \neffects of IFRS is likely to increase investor scrutiny of financial statements  following IFRS adoption , \nresulting in an increase in the likelihood of costly litigation and  regulatory  interventions.  Such \nconcerns lead auditors to protect their reputation capital  by increa sing their audit ing effort , reassessing \nclient risk , or both  (e.g., Clarkson , Ferguson , and Hall  2003; Francis and Krishnan 1999), which are \nlikely to manifest through increased audit fees.  \n8.2. Empirical evidence of the effects of IFRS on audit function  \nBased on a survey of 60 managers from Australia’s top 200 corporations, Jones and Higgins \n(2006) report that companies viewed their external auditors as the most involved party in the IFRS \nadoption process. Some of the respondents noted that auditors “woul d be instrumental —we don’t \nhave a big team, so they’ll be pretty heavily involved” (Jones and Higgins 2006 , p. 640). Other \nmanagers exhibited skepticism  at the role of the external auditor in the process, saying that their \nexternal auditors would not be us ed extensively in the transition. The e xpected involvement of \nexternal auditors was greater among larger firms (top 25% of the market cap italization ), although \nempirical analysis of the audit fees under  IFRS adoption , which we discuss later, suggests otherwise  \n(e.g., De George,  Ferguson , and Spear  2013).  \nKim, Liu, and Zheng (2012) examine the effect  of the IFRS mandate on audit pricing . They \nargue that because  IFRS is comprehensive, fair  value oriented, and principles  based, it require s more \ncomplex es timates and judgments by preparers and auditors, increasing the level of uncertainty and \nrisk of misstatement. Accordingly, t hey predict that IFRS increase audit fees and that, all else \nremaining equal, th is effect should be stronger in countries with more robust legal regime s, as auditors \nface higher legal liabilit ies in these countries.  The authors  empirically test these predictions using a' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 64}
page_content='64 \n broad sample of EU firms from 11 IFRS -adopting countries as treatme nt firms and firms in three non-\nadopting  OECD  countries (Japan, Canada , and the US) as a control group. They report evidence of an \nIFRS -related audit fee premium  that rises in reporting complexity and decreases in reporting quality  \nand in strength of a cou ntry’s legal regime . However, their use of Japan, the US, and Canada as a \ncontrol sample may affect their findings,  as these countries have different enforcement structures and \nfirms with significantly different reporting incentives compared  with EU countries. They also do not \nconsider  changes in regulations and enforcement s that have  concurrently occurred  with IFRS adoption \nin some EU countries.  Although  they attempt to overcome this contamination concern by using \ninformation from a survey capturi ng the  adequacy of firms’ implementation of audit and accounting \npractices , their analysis does not account for concurrent regulatory changes .51 Thus any observed fee \nincreases may simply be in response to increased regulatory and investor scrutiny, rather than auditing \nIFRS numbers per se.  \nFocusing on a single country, De George et al. (2013) examine the costs of audit verification \nfor a sample of 907 listed Australian firms , which cover approximately 80% of the total market \ncapitalization  on the Australian Stock Exchange . Using  a traditional audit -fee determinants model , the \nauthors find an economy -wide increase in the mean level of audit costs  of approximately 23 % in the \nIFRS transition  year, relative to pre -IFRS years,  that declin es to an increase of 8 % in later years. In \naddition, when they examine annual fee changes, they estimate an abnormal  IFRS -related increase in \naudit fees in excess of 8 % that is incremental to the normal yearly fee increases observed in the pre -\nIFRS period. They a lso find that smaller client  firms incur disproportionately more IFRS -related audit \ncosts relative to large r client  firms. Finally, using a self -constructed measure of IFRS audit \ncomplexity based on a survey of senior audit managers and partners, they document that audit fees are \nincreasing along with  the complexity of IFRS  audit s. As in any study of mandatory IFRS adoption , \nconfounding events remain a concern.  \nBased on  a sample of New Zealand firms, Griffin, Lont, and Sun ( 2009 ) examine the effect  of \nthe transition to IFRS on audit verification costs. The y implement  a standard audit -fee determinants \nmodel augmented with temporal indicator variables corresponding to the IFRS mandate for 653 firm -\nyear observations over 2002  through 2007. After controlling for company size, complexity, and risk, \nthey find a reliable increase in audit fees around the transition to IFRS (2004 –2006). They also find a \n                                                            \n51 They specifically  calculate a  country -level measure of concurrent reforms using data from the Annual \nExecutive Opinion Survey conducted by the Institute for Management Development. Although  the primary \npurpose of the survey is to provide quantifiable measurements of management practic es, labor relations , and \ncorruption, the survey explicitly asks respondents to evaluate the extent to which auditing and accounting \npractices are implemented in their firms adequately and the extent to which corporate boards supervise company \nmanagement ef fectively. The authors measure the changes in these scores from the pre -IFRS to post -IFRS \nperiod s.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 65}
page_content='65 \n general decrease in non -audit fees over their sample period, although they do not find that this change \nis related to the IFRS mandate.  \nShifting away from audit fees, Nobes and Zeff (2008) explor e the heterogene ity of auditors’ \nstatements related to  IFRS compliance. Examining the audit reports of all companies in the main \nstock indices of Australia, France, Germany, Spain , and the UK for the 2005 –2006 fiscal period, they \nfind a “widespread failure to assert compliance with IFRS when compliance has probably been \nachieved .” In particular, the audit reports of firms domiciled in France and Spain uniformly refer to \ncompliance with EU  IFRS only, i.e. , “IFRS as adopted by the EU .” However,  for some firms in the \nUK and Germany, audit reports  assert dual compliance to both local standards and “IFRS as issued by \nthe IASB .” Even more dissimilar, audit reports of Australian firms refer  only to compliance with \n“Accounting Standards in Australia ,” even though these standards are based closely and in some \ninstances exactly on IFRS. Nobes and Zeff (2008) argue that these differences in auditors ’ statements \nabout firm -level IFRS compliance may create problems for investor confidence and comparability. \nThey call for uniformity in audit report language to assert compliance with IFRS.  \nLoyeung, Matolcsy, Weber, and Wells (2011) attempt to link IFRS  adoption errors to audit \nquality for a sample of 184 Australian firms (from S&P/ASX 500) for which IFRS -compliant \nearnings turned out to be either overstated or  understated. They report that these accounting errors \nwere caused by  19 different accounting standards, indicating a broad difficulty in implementing IFRS.   \nThey also find that these transition errors were positively associated with IFRS -related changes i n \naudit fees and bid -ask spreads but negatively related to the tenure of C EOs and CFOs who were \nqualified accountants.  \nOverall, the evidence suggests that IFRS adoption has generally increased  the audit fees of \nfirms . But, at the same time, there  is need for more research  on how auditors affect IFRS reports. \nFuture research must  also focus on linking the  audit literature better to  the other observed effects of \nIFRS.  To what extent does the greater auditor effort, as observed in  the IFRS -related audit  premium, \ntranslate into  higher reporting  quality and help attain benefits for capital market participants ? Future \nresearch can also examine whether the integration of capital markets increases  after IFRS adoption \nand whether greater arm’ s length transacti ons are changing the nature of the audit function.

page_content='66 \n 9. Specific attributes of IFRS  \nThis section is devoted to  studies that focus on a single or  small number of specific attributes \nof the IFRS  reporting requirements. Focusing on specific attributes of IFRS permits  a more detailed \nunderstanding of the potential mechanisms  through which IFRS matter and a better understanding of \nthe measurement and implementation of a specific  standard. However, the difficulty in isolating \neconomic consequences attributable to specific standards when the entire accounting regime  has \nshifted  presents a major limitation of this setting . Moreover, the small samples typically examined  in \nthese studies  limit the  generaliz ability  of their results to a broader set of companies  and countries .  \nSection 9.1  reviews  the studies  that investigat e the effects of fair value accounting .  Section 9.2 \ndiscusses studies o f other attributes of IFRS.  \n9.1. Studies o f the fair value attribute of IFRS  \nThe recent financial crisis has pulled  fair value accounting into the spotlight . Under US \nGAAP, fair  value accounting is mainly limited to the measurement of financial assets and liabilities  \nwith unrealized gains and losses reflected in that period’s earnings or other comprehensive income \n(FAS 115)  and fair values disclosed in footnotes (FAS 117). Proponents of fair  value accounting \nargue that the fair value s of assets and liabilit ies improve transparency by reflect ing current market \ncondition s and provid ing timely information for decision -making . Opponents argue that in many cases \nfair value provides noisy information, especially for assets and liabilities that are held to maturity  or in \nthinly traded markets .52 \nRelative to US GAAP, IAS/IFRS allow a greater use of fair value accounting. In particular, \nfair value measurements are incorporated in to valuing various assets other than  financial assets and \nliabilities. For example, under IFRS, firms may choose to measure their  property, plant, and \nequipment  (PP&E ) (IAS 16) , intangibles  (IAS 38) , and investment property assets (IAS 40) at fair \nvalue. Although  biological assets must be recognized at fair value (IAS 41), firms are requi red to \nrecognize the cost of employee stock options using fair value s as at  the grant date (IFRS 2).53 In \naddition, IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets) allows firms to reverse previous impairment losses . The \nequivalent accounting treatments allowable under US GAA P are much more restrictive in their use of \nfair value accounting, if they are permitted at all. To this end, IAS/IFRS -adopting jurisdictions \nprovide researchers with a better opportunity to examine the implications and consequences of fair \nvalue accounting.  \n                                                            \n52 See Barth (2006), Laux and Leuz (2009) , and Ball et al. (2015) for detailed discussions about fair  value \naccounting.  \n53 Elad (2004) provides a discussion of the implementation of IAS 41 and offers a detailed comparison  of US \nGAAP and IFRS in terms of the measurement of agricultural assets. Giner and Arce (2012) and McAnally, \nMcGuire, and Weaver (2010) provide useful background information about the  adoption of IFRS 2 and its \ncomparison with SFAS 123 under US GAAP .' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 67}
page_content='67 \n To provide evidence o f the effects of the fair value accounting rules mandated by IFRS, \nresearch ers rely on two alternative approaches. Under the first approach, studies evaluate  cross -\nsectional  differences in the effects of IFRS across banks a nd non -banks to infer  the role of fair  value \naccounting in causing the observed effects. This approach is justified because , although IFRS require \nfair value accounting for a variety of asset classes, they tend to be most relevant for the recognition of \nfinancial assets and liabilities (Laux and Leuz, 2009) , and banks tend to recognize significant amounts \nof financial assets and liabilities. The second approach directly relies on the extent of firms’ fair  value \nmeasureme nts, typically for a small hand -collected sample, through a review of financial statements \nand policy notes. We discuss the specific findings from these two empirical strategies below . \nStudies by Armstrong et al. (2010) and Ball et al. (2015) are two  of the  many  that evaluate \ndifferences in  IFRS effects across banks and non -banks . However, they  reach different conclusions \nabout  the effects of fair value for different sets of investors. From the stock market investors’ \nperspective, Armstrong et al. (2010) conjecture that the emphasis of IFRS on fair  value accounting \nleads to an improvement in information quality. Consistent with this premise, they document more \npositive  stock market  reactions to IFRS adoption announcements for banks than nonbanks.  However, \nturning to debt markets, Ball et al. (2015) e xamin e the relevance of accounting numbers for use in \ndebt contracts  and argue that fair values are not useful for contracting . (See footnote 42 for further \ndiscussion .) Consistent with their arguments, they find  an incrementally lower usage of acc ounting -\nbased covenants among debt issued by banks relative to non -banks in the post -IFRS period.   \nDeFond, Hung, Li, and Li (2015) examine how the fair value consequences of IAS 39 affect \nthe stock  price crash risk for financial firms.  They observe that , on the one hand,  fair value may allow \nfirms to better reflect their underlying economics in financial report s, improving their reporting \ntransparency and thus lowering  their crash risk. While, on the other, fair value  may increase \nmeasurement errors in reported values of risky assets or encourage managers to invest  more in risky \nprojects (by amplifying the upside)  and thus increase the crash risk. Analyzing financial  and non-\nfinancial  firms  separately , the authors  find an increase in crash risk only amon g financial firms in \ncountries with weak banking regulations  and a dec line in  crash risk among non -financial firms.  Their \nresults highlight the importance of regulatory quality in  determining IFRS outcomes.  \nGiven the cross -sectional nature of these studies, inferences can only be summarized as \ndocumenting evidence consistent  with an increased use of fair  value accounting after IFRS adoption \nrather than a direct inference that fair  value accounting affects  information quality, contractibility  of \naccounting numbers , or crash risk.  \nAn alternative approach that partly mitigates  this problem involves relying on exposures to \nfair value rules by directly measuring the m from financial reports.  One prominent example is the fair  \nvalue measurements  of investment propert y assets  in the real estate industry , where firms’ operating' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 68}

IAS 40 (Investment Property) allows firms to choose between \nhistorical  cost and  fair value model s to account for investment properties.54 However, if a firm \nchooses the historical cost model, it must  disclose the fair values of its investment properties in \nfootnotes.  This setting has two advantages . First, there is a large cross -country variation in the \nvaluation models for investment property assets  allowable under domestic GAAP . This allows \nresearchers to explore cross -sectional variations in the adoption effect. For example, only the \nhistorical cost model is allowed under  domestic GAAP in France and Germany, only the fair value \nmodel is allowed under domestic GAAP in the UK and Denmark, and both models are allowed under \ndomestic GAAP in Belgium and the Netherlands.55 As firms in all of these countries have converged \nto IFRS , one can exploit the  heterogeneity in  the fair value changes that occur as a result of IFRS \nadoption.   Second, as the amount of fair value information is the same whether firms choose the fair \nvalue or historical  cost model  under the IFRS regime , this allows researchers to analyze firms’ \naccounting choice s between recognition and disclosure while holding the information environment \nconstant.  \nGoncharov, Riedl, and Sellhorn (2014) examine the effect of fair value reporting (through \nboth recognition and di sclosure) on audit fees. Using a sample of 172 European real estate firms \nduring  2001 –2008 , they  adopt  a difference -in-differences design and find that the firms that \npreviously us ed the amortized cost model under local GAAP exhibit ed greater declines in a udit fees \nwhen forced to adopt fair value accounting under IFRS relative to the firms that were already using  \nthe fair value model under local GAAP. The  authors  interview real estate audit partners , who suggest \nthat the higher audit fees initially observed  for firms using an amortized cost model stem med from the \ngreater audit effort required for impairments . They  empirically corroborate  these interview responses  \nin the data. In addition, cross -sectional analyses reveal that audit fees under IFRS reporting are (1) \nnegatively associated with firms’ exposure to fair  valued assets, (2) positively associated with the \ncomplexity of the fair value measurement , and (3) higher for fair value recognition than for  fair value \ndisclosure.   \nMuller, Riedl, and Sellhorn (2011) evaluate  the effect s of the increased disclosure of fair \nvalue s required under IFRS on the degree of information asymmetry faced by investors. Using a \nsample of 121 European real estate fi rms during 2003 –2007 , they find that firms that did not \nvoluntarily disclose fair values before mandatory IFRS adoption experience d larger improvements in \ninformation asymmetry, i.e., larger declines in their bid-ask spread s, upon IFRS adoption.  \n                                                            \n54 See a study by  Quagli and Avallone (2010) for a detailed discussion of IAS 40. The authors also provide \nempirical evidence that a firm’s decision to adopt fair value  accounting for investment properties under IAS 40 \nis a function of information asymmetry, contractual efficiency, and managerial opportunism.      \n55 See Appendix 1 of  a study by  Goncharaov, Riedl, and Sellhorn (2014) for a full list of countries in relati on to  \nthis issue.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 69}
page_content='69 \n Turning to the recognition  of fair value s, Liang and Riedl (2014) contrast real estate firms in \nthe UK with those in the US. Before IFRS adoption, UK GAAP required firms to recognize their \ninvestment property assets at fair value on their balance sheet s and report unrealized fair value \nchanges in a revaluation reserve. However, u nder IFRS, these  firms  recognize unrealized fair value \nchanges in net income while  continuing to  recognize investment property assets at  fair value on the  \nbalance sheet s.56 In con trast, US firms can use  only the historical  cost model to account for investment \nproperty assets. Liang and R iedl (2014)  exploit this difference in accounting standards between the \nUK and US to investigate the effect of fair  value accounting on analysts’ f orecasts.  Liang and Ri edl \n(2014) conjecture that the recognition of fair value in balance sheet s aids analysts by reveal ing \nmanagers ’ private information about  underlying asset value s and that the recognition of fair value \nchanges in net income makes earnings more difficult for analysts to  predict.  Consistent with this \nconjecture , they find that analysts’ forecast accuracy for net asset value (balance  sheet  based) is \nhigher for UK firms (over a period combining both  the pre- and post -IFRS -adoption periods) than for \nUS firms  and that the  forecast accuracy for earnings  is higher for US firms than for UK firms \nreporting under IFRS. They also find that the former result is attenuated during the financial  crisis \nperiod when asset value s are impaired, causing  the numbers reported under  the fair value model to \nconverge  toward  those reported under the historical cost  model . Their analysis  reveal s that analysts’ \nforecast accuracy for earnings is lower for UK firms  than for US firms  in pre -IFRS -adoption period , \nalthough this is not predicted by their conjectures. This result  indicat es that omitted correlated \nvariables may affect analysis .   \nIsraeli (201 5) uses a sample of 86 real estate firms from France, Germany, Italy, and Spain , \nwhere the fair value model for investment property assets was not permitted in pre -IFRS domestic \nGAAP , and examines their choice s between fair  value disclosure and recognition of investment \nprope rty assets under IFRS  during 2005 –2010 . The author  conjectures that managers opportunistically \nchose fair  value recognition to extract contractual benefits, i.e. , to avoid debt covenant violation s by \nreporting higher book values of equity and assets and to receive higher earnings -based compensation  \nby reporting  a higher net income . Consistent with this conjecture, he finds that firms with higher \nleverage (used as a measure  for firms’ proximity to debt covenant violation ) and more ownership \ndispersion (use d as a n inverse measure  for shareholder monitoring ) were more likely to adopt the \nrecognition regime.  However, this  conjecture is based on the assumption that fair  value recognition \nleads to higher  asset values and earnings, which need not be the case in practice.  \nMuller , Riedl , and Sellhorn  (2015)  study  the stock market implications  of fair value \ndisclosure versus fair value recognition  of investment property assets  for a sample of  245 EU real \n                                                            \n56 In theory, firms can choose between  the fair value and historical cost model under IFRS . However,  in \npractice , all of Liang and Riedl’s (2014) sample firms use the fair value model. They attribute this to the UK’s  \nlegacy of using  the fair value model for investment property assets under domestic UK GAAP.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 70}
page_content='70 \n estate firms over the 2003 –2010  period . They  document that equity prices have a lower association \nwith disclosed fair values than they do with  recognized fair values  and conclude  based on additional \nanalyses  that the discount for disclosures arises partly from the lower reliability of disclosed numbers \nand partly from the greater costs  involved in  processing disclosed numbers relative to recognized \namounts . The authors also evaluate the role of external appraisals in minimizing the stock  price \ndiscount associated with  disclosed fair values and finds that fair  value s based on  external apprais als \nhelp to decrease  the discount. Their findings contrast with those of Goncharov et al. (2014) , who  find \nthat the effect of fair  values on audit  fees is unaffected by the use of external appraisal s. \nChristensen and Nikolaev (2013) also examine firms’ accounting choice s but expand on prior \nstudies by including analyses of IAS 16 and IAS 38, which allow firms to choose between  the \nhistorical cost and fair value models when  measur ing their  PP& E and intangible assets, respectively.57 \nThey argue that firms choose fair value accounting only when reliable fair value estimates are \navailable at a low cost and when the estimates convey information about operating performance. \nConsistent with their argu ment, they find that few firms opt to use the  fair value model  to measure  \ntheir PP&E and intangible assets and that  real estate firms  especially  tend to choose the fair value \nmodel  to measure their investment property much more frequently.  Their results do  not rule out the \npossibility that firms’ choice of fair value accounting is driven by factors related to overall IFRS  \nadoption , rather than exclusively by the benefits and costs of fair value accounting on its own.  \nConsistent with this concern, Christens en and Nikolaev (2013) observe in their sample that 44% of \nUK firms switched to  the historical cost model from the fair value m odel for PP&E upon mandatory \nIFRS adoption, although these firms had the option to report under the historical cost  model,  even i n \nthe pre -IFRS period. If firms’ choice of fair value reporting was independent of IFRS adoption, then \nthese firms should have chosen the historical cost  model,  even in the pre -IFRS period.  \nIn the midst of the financial crisis, the EU called on the IASB to achieve a “ level playing \nfield” with US GAAP and allow entities  to reclassify financial assets . This would have allowed banks \nto use  reclassification to switch away from fair value accounting for assets that decreased  in value \nduring the financial crisi s and avoid recognizing unrealized losses. The IASB responded by \nintroducing an amendment to IAS 39 in 2008 that allowed firms to retrospectively use a non-fair-\nvalue method for non -derivative financial assets , provided the firm had the ability and intenti on to \nhold such assets for the foreseeable future and had not yet issued its financial statements at the time of \nthe amendment. Lim , Lim, and Lobo (2013) evaluate the effects of this reclassification option for a \nsample of 98 banks covering 21 IFRS -adoptin g countries and find that the reclassification choice \ndecreased  analysts’ ability to forecast earnings in the initial year of amendment adoption (2008 –2009) \nbut not in subsequent  years when the economic environment was less volatile.  \n                                                            \n57 Stolowy, Haller, and Klockhaus (2001) provide a detailed comparison of IAS 38 and French and German \nGAAP.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 71}
page_content='71 \n Panaretou, Shackleton, and Taylor (2013) examine the effect of using hedge accounting under \nIFRS on information asymmetry. They observe  that UK GAAP has less strict requirements for hedge \ndesignation  than IFRS  and that, unlike IFRS , UK GAAP permits histori cal cost accounting for certain \nhedging instruments . Based on these differences, they predict that IFRS adoption enhance s the quality \nof information provided by firms as to  their derivative instruments and corporate risk management \npractices, which should lower  information asymmetry. Using a sample of UK non -financial firms  for \nthe 2003 –2008  period , they provide evidence consistent with their predictions. They show that firms \nthat applied  hedge accounting  under IFRS  had lower analyst forecast errors and dis persion  relative to \nfirms without hedge accounting.  \nHe, Wong, and Young (2012) use a Chinese setting to examine the unintended consequences \nof implementing fair -value accounting in an emerging economy. Although China has not officially \nadopted IFRS, Chinese public firms switched accounting standards in 2007 to standards  substantially \nsimilar to IFRS. He et al. (2012) st udy earnings management around the switch in accounting \nstandards and report that Chinese firms manage earnings more to offset losses reported under fair  \nvalue accounting or through strategic reporting of fair  value gains and losses in the post -adoption \nperiod. They point to specific institutional details in China, such as close relationships between \ndebtors and creditors and political connections, that make such manipulations feasible.  However, one \nlimitation of their study i nvolves the  generalizability of  their results to other countries, as Chinese \nfirms face ownership structure s, regulation forces, and capital and business environments that are \ndrastically different from those of firms elsewhere . \nOne significant departure of IFRS from almost all domestic  GAAP  is the requirement of fair \nvalue biological assets (IAS 41). IAS 41  requires firms to recognize changes in the fair values of \nbiological assets as revenues or expenses in income statement s each year. Although this was a \nsubstantial change in accounti ng for biological assets, its effects receive  little attention from \nresearchers. Very few studies  directly evaluate the effects of this standard . Huffman (2014) studies  the \nvalue relevance of fair  value accounting  for biological assets and concludes that book value of equity \nand earnings are more value  relevant for consumable biological assets  (i.e., agricultural products such \nas crops or timber that realize value on a standalone basis and whose  value to the firm is linked to \nwhat may be exchanged for the asset in the marketplace)  measured at fair value and bearer biological \nassets (i.e., self-regenerating assets  such as  orchards or oil palm plantations that are used in \ncombination with other assets in the ongoing operations of the firm)  measured based on  historical \ncosts .58 However, using a larger sample, Goncalves and Lopes (2015) find that fair values are value \nrelevant for both consumable and bearer biological assets but do not reconcile their results with those \n                                                            \n58 Effective January 1, 2016, IFRS require firms to account for bearer biol ogical assets such as p roperty, plant, \nand equipment.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 72}

Focusing on Australia,  South Africa, and France, Elad (2004) provides a \ncommentary related to the  fair value rules for agricultu ral assets embodied in IAS 41.  \n9.2. Studies focusing on  the non-fair-value attributes of IFRS  \nHamberg, Paananen, and Novak (2011) examine the adoption  of IFRS 3 (Business \nCombinations) on financial reporting among a sample of Swedish firms.  Relative to prior Swedish \nGAAP, IFRS 3 abandons the amortization of capitalized goodwill and instead requires regular testing \nof goodwill for impairment. They find t hat firms recognize smaller goodwill impairments under IFRS \ncompared with the combined value of goodwill amortization and write -downs under Swedish GAAP, \ncausing reported earnings to be higher after  IFRS adoption.  Further more , by comparing the returns of \ngoodwill -intensive firms with those of firms with low levels of goodwill, they find that the stock \nmarket reacts positively to the se higher earnings under IFRS.  Their results suggest that stock market \nparticipants seem to find that the impairment model of g oodwill better reflect s underlying economic \nactivities compared with the previous amortization cost model.  Chalmers, Godfrey , and Webster \n(2011) substantiate this view for a sample of Australian firms.  \nFocusing on recognition rules for intangible assets, Cheung, Evans, and Wright (2008) report \nthat IFRS rules for intangible assets (IAS 38/AASB 138) are more stringent than previous Australian \nGAAP rules and that firms have consequently had to de -recognize a significant portion of intangible \nassets following  IFRS  adoption .  \nHsu and Pourjalali (201 5) examine the effect of adopting IAS 27 (Consolidated and Separate \nFinancial Statements) on stock markets’ ability to predict earnings.  The authors argue that compared \nwith local GAAP, IAS 27  decreases managers’ flexibility to hide losses and risks in unconsolidated \ninvestees , as it gives fewer choices to managers in terms of which investee -entities to consolidate.  \nUsing a sample of Taiwanese firms, the study  shows that the adoption of IAS 27 led to an increase in  \nforward earnings  response  coefficients (the proxy for the stock market’s ability to forecast earnings) \nfor firms that were forced under IFRS to consolidate at least one investee  entity.  \nFinally, Gebhardt and Novotny -Farkas (2011) examine the effect of IA S 39 adoption on \nincome smoothing and timely loss recognition among European banks. IAS 39 requires banks to \nrecognize only “incurred” losses on balance sheet s as opposed to recogniz ing “expected” losses in \nprior local GAAP. This incurred loss approach decreases  the scope of judgment and discretion in \ndetermining the loan loss provision relative to the expected loss approach used in local GAAP. The  \nauthors  find that the more restrictive IAS 39 impairment rules significantly decrease  the income \nsmoothing beh avior and timely loss recognition  of European banks.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 73}
page_content='73 \n 10. Empirical research design of IFRS studies  \nIn this section, we synthesize  the research design choices of IFRS studies with an aim to \nunderstanding the general trends in publications and research methodologies. This section is intended \nto be descriptive rather than normative , partly because  there are no clear prescriptions for many of the \neconometric choices involved in IFRS studies. Such choices (e.g., the level at which standard errors \nmust  be cl ustered or what types of fixed effects to include ) depend on econometric  assumptions \nrelated to the  unobserved properties of relevant variables. There are also no econometric tests  known \nto us  that adequately  justify or refute these assumptions. Although one can make a conservative \nselection of research methods, such an approach comes at  the cost of a loss of power in the tests and \nso is not necessarily preferable.  Simulation -based evidence also suggests that seemingly conservative \nchoices can sne ak biases into analyses (e.g., Petersen 2011).  \nMany IFRS studies currently discuss  the sensitivity of their results to research choices . \nHowever, the discuss ions tend to be brief  and limited in terms of  the effect on the final inference . \nVery few  studies  tabulate results from these sensitivity checks . Tabulating such results (at least in an \nInternet appendix) may help other researchers  obtain a deeper understanding of  the drivers of the \nreported results , aid in the replication  of results,  and reconcile the differences in results across studies .  \nAs this section primarily focuses  on documenting the empirical choices made by IFRS \nstudies, we keep explanations and discussions of various econometric issues to a minimum and \ninstead restrict our discussions to h ow studies address these econometric issues.  As our  analysis is \nintended to give a n overview of trends in research choices rather than exhaustive analysis of all  of the  \nresearch methods  adopted  in the literature, we limit our focus to the same set of papers identified for \nthis review from Contemporary Accounting Research , Journal of Accounting and Economics , Journal \nof Accounting Research , Review of Accounting Studies , and  The Accounting Review  from 1999  \nthrough 2015. We exclude discussion papers, opinion pieces, theor y papers , experiments, and surveys \nfrom analysis . Our final sample consists of 64 published articles.  A majority of these studies consider  \nIFRS/IAS adoption as the primary research objective or use it as the primary research setting. For \nthese studies , our analysis focuses  only on their main research design s. A few studies use the IFRS \nadoption setting not as part of their main analysis but as part of their  robustness analysis. For these \nstudies , our analysis focuses on their research design as it pertain s to IFRS/IAS adoption.  \n10.1. Sample distribution  \nTable 1 lists the number of studies published  by each journal and their years of publication .  \nThere has been a gradual increase in the number of publications, especially after 2007, probably  due \nto the EU’s mandatory IFRS adoption in 2005.  Table 2 lists the number of publications by author \ncountry, which is determined by the location of an author’s affiliation. We count the total number of' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 74}
page_content='74 \n articles with at least one co -author affiliation located in that country as shown on the  publication. This \ntable shows a wide geographic distribution.  Although  US researchers continue to dominate, over 50% \n(i.e., 35 out of 64) of the  studies have at least one co -author with  an affiliation outside the US. We \nsuspect that no other research topic is likely to have such a large fraction of non -US researchers  in \nstudies  published in the select ed five journ als. Researchers from the EU and Hong Kong dominate the \nlist of n on-US researchers  publishing IFRS -related works. It is likely that these researchers have been \nstimulated by IFRS adoption in their home countries  and have benefited from their proximity to \ncountry -specific information about the effects of  IFRS.  \n10.2. Data sources  \nIFRS studies rely primarily on WorldScope as their primary source of firms’ financial \ninformation and Datastream as the ir source of stock market information. Of these 64 studies, 4 7 use \nDatastream/WorldScope (Table 3). Some of the studies also use Compustat Global for firm -level \ninformation , and many of the studies use both Datastream/WorldScope and Compustat Global.  \nAlthough WorldScope has a larger coverage, especially for emerging markets in early years, its data \nwere un available in a user -friendly format for researchers  until recently.  Compustat Global has been \navailable  longer through Wharton Research Data Service (WRDS) , and this has allowed researchers \neasier access to th e dataset  and made it easier  to merge  with other WRDS  databases . Some early \nstudies rely on Bloomberg as their data source for firm -level information ( e.g., Ashbaugh and Pincus \n2001; Ashbaugh and Olsson 2002).  \nAlthough it is not yet widely used by researchers, FactSet  is a database for firm -level \naccounting information available through WRDS. FactSet purchased WorldScope in April 2008 and \nthus acquired its firm -level accounting information for over  43,000 firms globally starting from 1980.  \nSince May 2010, FactSet has started collecting firm -level accounting information by itself.  \nSome of the studies , particularly those  analyzing  US GAAP -IFRS reconciliation s, use hand -\ncollected data.  Such informatio n is extracted from  either  the financial statements of global firms or the \nSEC’s Form 20 -F filings of firms cross -listed in the US.  \n10.3. Multi - versus  single -country  settings  \nMost IFRS/IAS studies use an international sample of firms for  their treatment sample s.  Of \nthe 64 studies  analyzed here , 18 use a single -country treatment sample , and one uses a two-country \nsetting .59 Of these 19 studies , the UK ( seven studies ) and Germany ( four studies ) are the most \nfrequently examined  countries.  \n                                                            \n59 Of the studies adopting  a single -country research design, five focus on firms cross -listed in the US , and one \nuses firms cross -listed in the UK. We count these studies as using the US or UK as a singl e treatment country.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 75}
page_content='75 \n A major advantage of using a multi -country setting is that the results can typically be \ngeneralize d to a wide r variety of firms and a wider set of  institutional and enforcement factors. Such \nstudies also can conduct cross -country analysis of the role of co untry characteristics in influencing \nIFRS outcomes. The sample s used in multi -country analysis are also typically larger, yielding greater \npower of tests. However , studies focusing on a single IFRS -adopting country have their own \nadvantages. Single -country  setting s allow  researchers to focus on a more homogenous sample of firms \nwith broadly comparable ownership structures and capital market incentives.  They  also hold legal and \nregulatory factors constant and enable researchers to delve deeper into analysis of institutional details,  \nadopt  better identification strategies , and better control for potential confounding events.  \nWe discuss the unique features of a few individual countries that have been favored in single -\ncountry settings  as follows . \n10.3. 1. Studies focusing on German firms  \nGerman y is a unique case in that before  mandatory IFRS adoption in 2005  German firms were \nreporting under a variety of accounting standards , including  German GAAP, IAS , and US GAAP. \nThis allows comparisons across  firms  that are largely similar  except for their choice s of accounting \nstandards . This approach can help  isolate the effects of accounting standards from the effects of legal , \nregulatory , and political factors. However, these samples generally suffer from self -selection \nproblems associated with firms voluntarily choosing a specific accounting standard or include a  \nnonrandom sample of  firms, such as high-tech firms listed on the New Market.  \nAnother feature of the German setting is its stakeholder -oriented accounti ng system, which \noverlaps significantly with the country’s tax rules . German GAAP also allow s only historical cost \naccounting . Examples of studies  that use the German setting  include those by Bartov  et al. (2005), \nChristensen et al. (2015), Daske (2006), Hung and Subramanyam (2007) , Leuz (2003), and Van \nTendeloo and Vanstraelen (2005).   \n10.3.2. Studies focusing on UK firms  \nAs the UK did not allow early adoption of IFRS, the setting allows researchers to clearly \nstudy the effects of mandatory IFRS adoption  without contaminat ion based on  the influence of early \nvoluntary adopters. Furthermore , outside of the US, the UK has the largest set of actively traded \nstocks , for which a relatively long history of accounting and stock market data are available. Th is \nmakes it possible  for a single IFRS -adopting country  to produce a relatively large sample . Finally, the \nUK provides accounting data that are electronically readable for  the largest sample of private firms.60 \n                                                            \n60 Horton and Serafeim (2010) provide a detailed discussion of the  effects  of IFRS relative to local UK GAAP \nfor key accounting areas, i.e. , leases, employee benefits, share -based payments, deferred taxes, goodwill and \nintangibles, and  financial instruments.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 76}
page_content='76 \n Examples of studies that have u sed the UK setting are those by Brochet et al. (2013),  Christensen and \nNikolaev (2013) , Liang and Riedl (2014), and Panaretou  et al. (2013).        \n10.3.3. Studies focusing on Australia  \nAustralia required all of its firms without exception to adopt  IFRS for financial periods \nbeginning on or after January 1, 2005 . Thus, unlike many other jurisdictions , there was no staggered \nadoption.  Although voluntary adoption was permitted, very few firms (less than 1 %) chose to do so . A \ndistinct feature of Australia’s adoption of IFRS is that all corporations  in the country , both listed and \nunlisted, must report under IFRS . This removes  incentives for  Australian firms to delist to report \nunder an alternative accounting standard.  It also make s it a particularly interesting setting to test the \neffects of IFRS on private firms and the overall economy . Examples of studies that have used the \nAustralian setting are  those by  Chalmers, Clinch, and Godfrey (2011), Cheung  et al. ( 2008), De \nGeorge et al. (2013), Jones and Higgins  (2006) , and Lai et al. (2013) .     \n10.3.4. Studies focusing on cross -listed firms  \nSince 1982, the SEC has required f oreign firms cross -listed in the US stock markets to \nreconcil e their financial statement numbers based in local GAAP  to US GAAP.  Such reconciliations \nprovide researchers with the opportunit y to compare reported financial statement numbers across two \ndifferent accounting regimes for the same firm and year. However, i n November 2007, the SEC vot ed \nto allow foreign companies to file financial statements based on IFRS without having to reconcile  the \ndata to US GAAP, i.e. , eliminate 20 -F reconciliations. IFRS  studies also investigate cross -listing in \nother countries, especially in the Stock Exchange  Automated Quotations  system of the  International \nEquity Market of London , which allows  firms to report under either IAS or US GAAP. This setting \nallows  for the  comparison of accounting standards for firms from a single equity market.  \nThe cross -listing setting presents a drawback:  although these firms are traded in the same \nequity markets, they are incorporate d in different countries and  are therefore likely  to face different \ndomestic regulatory forces and reporting incentives. Another limitation of this type of research is the \npotential bias that arises from  firms self -selecting to cross -list their shares.  \n10.4. Empirical methodology  \nIn this subsection, we  review the empirical methods adopted  in our selected 64 IFRS studies.  \nAlthough  some  studies rel y on cross -sectional comparisons across firms reporting under IFRS and \nthose reporting under other standards to investigate the properties of IFRS financial reports, IFRS \nstudies  and especially those evaluating the effects of IFRS adoption rely predominantly on a \ndifference -in-differences approach . This approach compares  changes in specific attributes around the \nevent date for a treatment sample relative to a control sample. We review the c rucial methodological \nelements in volved in the  empirical  analysis  approach  of IFRS studies in general. Although  many of' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 77}
page_content='77 \n the issues discussed are relevant to both cross -sectional and difference -in-difference s analyses, we pay \nspecial attention to the latter approach in Section 10.4.4 , given its predominance in the IFRS \nliterature . The subsequent subsection s present issues pertain ing to the following methodological \nchoices: (i) event  selection , (ii) event date identification, (iii) choice of event  window, (iv) choice of \ntreatment and co ntrol samples , (v) controls for fixed effects, (vi) adjustments  for correlated \nobservations , and (viii) measurement of control variables .  \n10.4.1. Event selection  \n9.3.1.1.  Voluntary adoption and endogeneity concerns  \nA key issue associated with  voluntary adoption studies is the potential  endogeneity that arises \nfrom firms self -selecting to adopt IAS/IFRS. That is, the unobserved factors driving firms to \nvoluntarily adopt IAS/IFRS may drive the observed changes in the attributes examined, rather than \nthe IAS/IFRS adoption itself. Studies use a variety of techniques to address this concern, the most \nprominent one being the use of a two-stage Heckman -type treatment effect model.  In practice, this \napproach is often not entirely satisfactory to rule o ut self -selection concerns due to  the absence of \nvalid instrument variables in the first -stage regression that can be excluded from the second -stage \nregression with appropriate economic justifications (Larcker and Rusticus 2010).  \nHowever, a few studies go beyond relying solely on the Heckman approach.  For instance, \nKim and Shi (2012) show that documented differences across voluntary adopters and non -adopters \nexist only after IFRS  adoption and not before , indicating that the observe d changes for voluntary \nadopters are likely to be attributable to the adoption itself. They also confirm that their results are \ndriven only by changes occurring to treatment firms rather than by changes occurring in control firms. \nFurther more , they present  their results using the propensity -score matching and two-stage least \nsquares approach es as alternative econometric techniques to address self -selection biases. Finally, \nthey provide cross -sectional evidence that pre -adoption divergence between local GAAP  and IFRS \nrelate s to the changes observed around IFRS adoption.  Although  none of these approaches can \nentirely rule out self -selection biases  on its own, the robustness of the results to various econometric \nchecks increases confidence that the documented c hanges around IFRS are unlikely to be driven by \nomitted correlated variables or unobserved factors that drive firms to voluntarily adopt IFRS.  \nChristensen (2012) raises an interesting point in the context of voluntary IFRS adoption. As \nseveral studies document significant benefits arising from voluntary IFRS adoption, he asks why so \nvery few firms voluntarily adopt IFRS . Almost all of the firms that voluntarily adopted IFRS in the \npre-2000 period were located in  the EU , and, as the EC had outlined its s trategy to eventually mandate \nIFRS, Christensen (2012) argues that these adoptions were not truly voluntary. He rules out the \npossibility that it was the high cost of voluntary IFRS adoption that discouraged firms . Although the' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 78}
page_content='78 \n costs of IFRS compliance are  likely to be low in weak enforcement countries, there is little evidence \nof voluntary IFRS adoption in such countries.  Christensen (2012) concludes that the benefits observed \nfrom voluntary IFRS adoption must be driven by endogeneity problems or correlate d omitted \nvariables, suggesting that the controls for these biases in current studies are insufficient. Consistent \nwith the concerns of Christensen (2012), Daske et al. (2013) find that the change in disclosure \nincentives  for adopting firms  drives the docu mented capital market benefits  following  voluntary IAS \nadoption.  \n9.3.1.2.  Mandatory adoption and contamination concerns  \nMandatory IFRS adoption is less subject to the endogeneity criticism, as adoption is  \nperformed  at the country  level and is beyond the choice  of individual firms . From this perspective, \nmandatory adoption is naturally a preferred event for researchers. However, this setting presents its \nown empirical issues . First, as most countries mandated IFRS between 2005 and 2008, the IFRS \nadoption dates are c lustered in time, raising contamination concerns from  events  that are entirely \nunrelated to IFRS adoption. Second, changes in regulation or enforcement bundled with IFRS \nadoption, such as the EU regulation that require s member states to introduce relevant enforcement and \ncompliance mechanisms along with mandatory IFRS adoption, can also confound the direct effects of \nIFRS adopti on. \nChristensen et al. (2013) illustrate the contamination concerns in the context of liquidity \nchanges documented by prior studies  around mandatory IFRS adoption in the EU. They find that  \npreviously observed improvements in liquidity  are actually isolated within  five EU countries that \nsubstantially changed their enforcement of financial reporting around the time IFRS became \nmandatory . They find no evidence of liquidity improvements  surrounding  the IFRS mandate in \ncountries without concurrent changes in enforcement. Moreover, in additional analysis of voluntary \nadopters only, they continue to find significant liquidity improvements aro und the mandate event in \ncountries with concurrent changes in enforcement. Given  that these firms  had already  voluntarily  \nadopted IFRS before the  mandate , the findings suggest  that liquidity improvements occurred absent a \nchange in reporting standards.  The authors conclude that changes in financial reporting enforcement \nplay a crucial role in explaining liquidity changes around IFRS adoption and that IFRS adoption itself \nis unlikely to be a primary source of capital market benefits.  \nAlthough the findings of Christensen et al. (2013) underscore the importance of addressing \nconfounding effects, Barth and Israeli (2013)  point out that the evidence presented by Christensen et \nal. (2013) is insufficient to  completely  rule out the effects o f IFRS adoption. They specifically note \nthe following , referring to Christensen et al. as “CHL .”' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 79}
page_content='79 \n Importantly, the specifications in CHL Tables 3, 4, and 5 do not distinguish effects of \nchanges in enforcement from effects of IFRS adoption. Although the find ings in these tables \nallow CHL to rule out an effect of IFRS on liquidity for countries that did not adopt \nconcurrent changes in enforcement, the findings do not rule out an effect of IFRS for \ncountries that did adopt concurrent changes in enforcement. In other words, the findings in \nCHL Tables 3, 4, and 5 do not tell us the effect of changes in enforcement by themselves and, \nthus, we cannot compare the liquidity of IFRS adopters with changes in enforcement to that \nof non -adopters with changes in enforcemen t … This comparison is necessary if one is to rule \nout an effect of IFRS.61 \nRecent research has aimed to address concerns about the  confounding effects of mandatory \nIFRS adoption by checking the robustness of results to (i) focusing only on IFRS -adopting countries \nthat did not concurrently change their regulation or enforcement practices , (ii) using countries outside \nthe EU that adopted IFRS at different periods ( such as Canada) , and (iii) relating the effects of IFRS \nto cross -sectional differences between  IFRS and domestic GAAP.  The logic behind the last set of \nanalyses is that , if IFRS adoption produces certain benefits, these benefits should be larger in \ncountries where IFRS adoption has a larger  effect  on reporting standards.    \nOverall,  the debate o ver whether  the observed changes in  financial reporting outcomes and \ncapital market benefits are due to the IFRS mandate or changes in enforcement may never be settled \nempirically.  Results  in extant literature  may need  interpretation  assuming that IFRS adopti on \nrepresent s the entirety of the changes to the financial reporting system, including the application of \nnew accounting standards and the chang es in enforcement and litigation.  \nIn addition to the contamination concern, Ramanna and Sletten (2014) show that  mandatory \nIFRS adoption at the country level is not always entirely exogenous. They find that a country’s \ndecision to adopt IFRS is an endogenous choice determined by the country’s perceived network \nbenefits. That is, a country is likely to adopt IFRS if the other countries with which it has close \neconomic ties have already adopted IFRS.  \n9.3.1.3.  Type of IFRS  adoption  investigated  \nTo provide some insights into researchers’ choice of adoption event to study, Figure 1 plots \nthe number of articles classified by adoption type and publication year. Before the large -scale \nmandatory adoption of IFRS in 2005, studies had little choice in exploring  the adoption event , a point  \nemphasized given  that almost all studies until 2008 focused on voluntary IFRS adoption. In contrast, \n                                                            \n61 Christensen et al. (2013)  present a test in Table 6 of their study to separately identify the liquidity effects \narising exclusively from enforcement changes. They investigate liquidity changes for Japanese firms around \n2004, when Japan changed its enforcement practices without changing  its accounting standards. Although  their \nanalysis provides some evidence  that support s the  enforcement changes affecting stock liquidity, it is unclear \nwhether these results can be generalized to oth er contexts or countries, as Japan saw large changes in the \nfunctioning of its banks and capital markets between 2001 and 2007 , when regulators introduced new laws \naimed at decreasin g non -performing loans on banks’ balance sheets.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 80}
page_content='80 \n since 2008, only a handful of published studies focus exclusively on voluntary adoption. Many studies \nafter 2008 examin e both voluntary and mandatory IFRS adopters.  We surmise that the trend toward \nusing both as alternative subsamples is at least partly driven by the econometric concerns related to  \neach of these adoption types. Based on the presumption that econometric bia ses are independent for \nmandatory and voluntary adopters, researchers interpret a consistent set of results for both \nsubsamples , providing greater confidence in  the inferences drawn about the role of IFRS.  \n10.4.2. Identification of e vent date \nA key issue in any event study is the accurate identification of the event date. For studies of \nmandatory IFRS adoption, the event date is relatively straightforward , as it is publicly released by the \nregulators in each country.  However, even in this case , care is needed to identify the event date , as \nadoption dates may be staggered. Table 4 lists the country -level adoption dates with notable \nexceptions and carve -outs. When the EU initially mandated IFRS, firms that had their equity \nsecurities traded in maj or stock exchanges had to adopt IFRS for fiscal periods  beginning on or after \nJan. 1, 2005. However, companies that had only publicly traded debt securities or report ed under US \nGAAP could delay adoption of IFRS to 2007  if the country allowed it . Moreover,  some countries , \nsuch as Austria, Belgium , and Germany , allowed early adoption of IFRS, and other countries , such as \nFrance, Spain, and the UK, prohibited early adoption.  Examining the actual adoption and compliance \nrate after the EU’s official mandate in 2005, Pownall and Wieczynska (2012) find that as much as \n35% of the firms did not adopt IFRS  in 2005 . Consistent with staggered adoption, they show that this \nfigure subsequently drop ped to 20% by 2007 and further to 17.8% by 2009.62 \nThe c orrect identificati on of IFRS adoption dates is more challenging for firms that voluntarily \nadopt IFRS.  Most studies identify adoption dates through time -series comparison s of accounting \nstandards listed in either the WorldScope (data field 07536) or Compustat Global (variab le name: \nASTD) databases. However, Daske et al. (2013, see appendix) point out significant differences in the \ncoding of accounting standards across these two databases. When they classify accounting standards \ninto three broad categories (IAS -IFRS, US GAAP,  or local GAAP) and compare the coding of \nreporting standards across the two databases, they find classification differences for about 5% of the \nfirm-year observations covered by both databases. However, when attention is restricted to the \nsubsample of fir m-year observations coded as IFRS followers by either database, this value  jumps to \nnearly 30%. Even more worryingly, when they compare the accounting standards reported in these \ntwo databases against corresponding data hand -collected from annual reports, they find classification \ndifferences in about 25% of the observations for WorldScope and about 40% for Compustat Global. \nAlthough  Daske et a l. (2013) check  the data for annual reports that are electronically downloadable \n                                                            \n62 For details about the  options available to EU member states in relation  to mandatory IFRS adoption, see Table \n1 in a study by Pownall and Wieczynska (2012).' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 81}
page_content='81 \n from Thomson Reuters, their hand -collected sample covers only about 15% of the firm -years covered \nby WorldScope and Compustat Global. Given the large discrepancies in reportin g accounting \nstandards observed in this subsample, further research is required to clearly understand these \nclassification differences.  Until such time, researchers should be better off using the data that Daske et \nal. (2013) make available online and ackn owledging this data limitation.  \n10.4.3. Selection of e vent window  \nResearchers  have  chose n a variety of event windows, such as a fixed number of years around \nthe event date or the entire sample period for which data are available. For example, DeFond et al. \n(2011) and Hong, Hung, and Lobo (2014) use 2003 –2004 as the pre -adoption period and 2006 –2007 \nas the post -adoption period and exclude the adoption year , 2005. The former examine the effect of \nIFRS adoption on institutional ownership , and the latter examine the effect of IFRS adoption on IPOs.  \nMeanwhile, Chen, Young, and Zhuang (2013) use a sample period between 2000 and 2009 to \nexamine the cross -border spillover effects of the EU’s  mandatory adoption  of IFRS  in 2005 on the \ninvestmen t efficiency  of firms . Although their sample includes 10 years in total, they do not determine \nfrom the data  whether the effects of IFRS occur immediately after adoption or take time to be \nobserved.  \nIn general , a lack of consistency in empirical choices ac ross IFRS studies makes it difficult to \ncompare their results. Although  a short window around the adoption date has the advantage of \nmitigating contamination concerns, such an approach may be affected by transitory changes ( e.g., \nfrom learning) that occur around IFRS adoption and suffer from a lack of power in tests when a \nsufficient number of observations  is unavailable in the short  window.  Studies should ideally focus on \nboth shorter and longer event windows to show whether obser ved effects are persistent or temporary  \nand provide useful evidence related to  inter-temporal trends . (See Table 4 in a study by Hail et al. \n[2014 ] as an example .) This approach would also help researchers better link evidence across  various \nstudies.  \n10.4. 4. Estimation of the difference -in-difference s model  \nA typical approach used to measure the effects of IFRS adoption is to estimate a difference -in-\ndifferences model, such as the following:  \n DV = β 1 IFRS + β 2 Post + β 3 Post×IFRS+ Controls  + ε, (1) \nwhere DV is the outcome variable of interest, IFRS  is an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 for \nIFRS -adopting firms (treatment firms) and 0 for control firms, and Post is an indicator variable that \ntakes the value of 1 for fiscal periods after the IFRS a doption date. β3, which captures the difference -\nin-difference s effect, is the main coefficient of interest. In the absence of control variables in Equation' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 82}
page_content='82 \n (1), β3 can be interpreted as the change in DV for treatment firms relative to the change in DV for the \ncontrol group. We discuss a few  of the  issues that frequently arise when  estimating the preceding  \nequation  as follows . \n10.4.4.1.  Sample of control or non -treated firms  \nStudies of mandatory IFRS adoption often choose one of  two sets of firms as the control (or \nnon-treated) group : (i) firms reporting under local GAAP (including US GAAP) from non -IFRS -\nmandating countries or (ii) voluntary adopters from countries that subsequently mandate d IFRS. In \ncontrast, studies of voluntar y adoption use firms from the same country as the treatment sample  and \nfirms  that do not report under IFRS as the control group.  \nAlmost all IFRS studies present a major concern about the comparability of firms in the treated \nand non -treated groups. Control  and treatment groups should ideally be formed by randomly \nallocating firms to the two groups, so that the two groups do not differ in any dimension other than the \ntreatment effect  on average .  However, this is unlikely to be the case in almost all studies . A key \nassumption of the difference -in-difference s model is that the average change in outcome is the same \nfor both the non -treated firms and counterfactually for treated firms  if they ha ve not received the \ntreatment. As such,  whet her observable or unobservable,  the differences in characteristics across \ntreatment and control groups in the pre -IFRS -adoption period always present a concern for the \ninferences drawn from Equation (1).  \nIn fact, the preceding  concerns simply increase in severity as more an d more countries mandate \nIFRS, leaving fewer countries and fewer firms for inclusion in the control group.  As Table 4  indicates , \nonly four major economies ( namely, the US, Japan, China, and India) remain ed non-IFRS  adopters at \nthe end of 2013. However,  IFRS ha ve affected the local reporting  of even these countries . For \nexample, the Chinese Accounting Standards that have been  mandatory since Jan . 1, 2007 , have \nsubstantially converged with IFRS.  US GAAP ha ve been influenced through the Norwalk Agreement \nsigned in September 2002 to achieve convergence between US GAAP and IFRS. Both India and \nJapan currently allow voluntary IFRS adoption.  A related concern about using firms from non -IFRS -\nadopting countries as control firms is the potential convergence of loca l GAAP with IFRS in \nanticipation of mandatory adoption. For instance, some of the countries included in control groups in \nstudies of mandatory IFRS adoption subsequently adopted IFRS , e.g.,  Canada adopted IFRS in 2011 \nbut also allowed early adoption of IF RS. A Canadian firm might have started to prepare for this \ntransition before  actual adoption, contaminat ing its  role as a control.  \nStudies attempt to account for observable differences across treated and non -treated firms by \nincluding additional factors li nearly in to Equation (1). However,  the success of this approach depends' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 83}
page_content='83 \n on whether the control variables are correctly measured and specified in the model. Another approach \nthat is adopted  to deal with observable differences is the  matched -firm approach, in which  each \ntreatment firm is matched to a control firm (or a set of control firms) along certain dimensions such as \nindustry, size, or propensity  score.  The matched  firm is particularly relevant if one believes that the \ntrue relation ship between control  and outcome variables is non -linear. After proper control or \nmatching, one should observe no differences between the treatment and control groups in the pre -\nIFRS -adoption  period , i.e., an insignificant β1. However, as DeFond, Erkens, and Zhang (2015) poin t \nout, any  conclusions drawn from propensity -score matching  analysis may be very sensitive to the \ndesign choice, including the number of control firms matched to each treatment firm, the non -linear \nterms included in the propensity score construction, and w hether the matching is done with or without \nreplacement.  They suggest an alternative matching procedure, i.e., c oarsened exact matching, which \nmatches control and treatment firms based on ranges rather than the exact covariate  value s. Even if  \nthe preceding  approaches satisfactorily control for observable differences across treated and non -\ntreated groups, concerns remain in relation  to unobserved differences across treated and non -treated \nfirms.  \nConsidering all of the advantages and shortcomings of each control group, a relatively \nparsimonious approach would involve  present ing the  results using three different samples of firms for \nthe control group , including  (i) all  non-adopting  firms from non -IFRS -adopting  countri es, (ii) \npropensity -score -matched firms from non -IFRS -adopting  countries , and (iii) voluntary adopters  \npreferably  from IFRS -adopting  countries. DeFond et al. (2015)  provide a n example of such an \napproach and nicely summarize the pros and cons of each contr ol group as follows . \nEach of the three benchmarks has its advantages and limitations. Voluntary adopters \nshare economic and regulatory commonality with mandatory adopters, but they are often \nregarded as a non -random group subject to potential self -selectio n bias. Non -IFRS adopters or \nPSM non -IFRS adopters, on the other hand, control for contemporaneous effects that are \nunrelated to the introduction of IFRS, but are potentially influenced by unspecified cross -\ncountry differences. In addition, while PSM non -IFRS adopters reduce differences between \ntreatment and control firms, the theoretical underpinning of our PSM model is limited \nbecause we should be using country -level factors to model the choice of mandatory IFRS \nadoption in order to derive our propensity scores. However, because we need to match at the \nfirm level, we necessarily use firm -level determinants.  \nBecause of the limitations of the benchmark groups, we draw our conclusions based \non the results of all three benchmarks in our primary analysis. For p arsimony, we present our \nsubsequent partitioning and sensitivity analysis using just one of our benchmarks, the non -\nIFRS adopters. Besides having the largest sample size, this benchmark avoids the self -\nselection bias with the voluntary adopters, and the li mited theoretical underpinning with the \nPSM non -IFRS adopters.  \nYet another concern related to difference -in-difference model s is that estimated outcomes can \nreflect the effects of either IFRS adoption or contaminated events for the control  sample. Unlike the' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 84}
page_content='84 \n ideal setting , in which  treatment firms differ from control firms only in terms of the treatment \nreceived, IFRS settings do not rule out the possibility that control firms are affected by contamination \nevents that influence  the outcome variables. In such a case, the estimated difference -in-differences \ncoefficient may appear statistically significant even though the IFRS adoption itself has no significant \neffect  on the treatment firms. Thus, in the context of Equation (1), a significant v alue of β3 may be \ninterpreted to indicate a  significant IFRS adoption effect for treated firms or alternatively that effects \nfrom a contamination event on the control firms are irrelevant for the treated firms. A few studies \n(e.g., Kim and Shi 2012; Ball e t al. 2015) attempt to mitigate this concern by documenting that \ninferences are insensitive to dropping control firms  from  analyses.63 \nFurthermore,  IFRS adoption may cause sample attrition or enlargement. Such changes cause \nthe firms included in the sample in the pre -IFRS period to differ from those included in the post -IFRS \nperiod. If IFRS adoption relate s to the sample changes in the sense that IFRS adoption affects the \nprobability of sample attrition/enlargement, then  the coefficient estimates from the difference -in-\ndifference s model are biased. For example, in the context of external financing, IFRS adoption may \nimprove financial transparency and thereby increase investors’ willingness to invest in publicly traded \nsecurities. This would incentivize more  firms to raise external financing in the post -IFRS period,  \npotentially  biasing the  difference -in-differences estimates obtained from a sample of firms issuing \ndebt or equity around IFRS adoption. Similar concerns arise when IFRS adoption causes sample \nattrition by affecting the probability of liquidation or acquisition. One approach that studies use to test \nthe sensitivity of results to this sample bias is to focus on a constant sample of firms, i.e., includ e only \nfirms for which outcome variables are avai lable in both the pre - and post -IFRS periods. However, \nrequiring firms to be present in both the pre - and post -IFRS period s may introduce its own data \nsnooping biases, such as survivorship bias . \n10.4.4.2. Inclusion of fixed effects  \nTo control for firm -specific determinants of the outcome variable of interest, some studies \ninclude firm fixed effects in Equation (1). These fixed effects essentially ensure that the estimated \ndifference -in-difference s coefficient does not reflect differences in time -invariant characteristics  \nacross control and treatment firms . Studies alternatively  include country fixed effects to control for \nunobservable country characteristics , industry fixed effects to control for u nobservable industry \ncharacteristics , or both . In addition, IFRS studies also typically include period fixed effects ( e.g., year \nor quarter) to control for unobservable time effects.  \n                                                            \n63 Although  insignificant values for β1 and β2 in Equation (1) would provide some comfort that IFRS -adopting  \nand control f irms are comparable and that IFRS adoption does not affect control samples, the values for these \ncoefficients are not often reported separately, as they are subsumed by the inclusion of fixed effects  in the \ndifference -in-differences model .' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 85}
page_content='85 \n Figure 2 plots the percentage of the 64 publications using different dim ensions of fixed effects \nin their main analysis.  Before  2008 , when most studies focused on voluntary IFRS adoption, fixed \neffects were rarely used in main analys es. Only 14% of the studies published before 2008 use fixed \neffects models. In contrast, all of the studies published in 2015 include at least one dimension of fixed \neffects. In all of the periods, firm fixed effects appear to be the least frequently used relative to either \ncountry or industry fixed effects. Only four of the sixty -four studies , including those by Daske et al. \n(2008) ; Horton, Serafeim, and Serafeim (2013) ; Chen, Young, and Zhuang (2013) ; and Lang and \nStice -Lawrence (2015) , include firm fixed effects in their main regression models . This is perhaps  due \nto the large loss in degree  of freedom that results when firm fixed effects are included, which lower s \nthe power of tests.  \n10.4.4.3. Clustering standard errors  \nFigure 3 plots the percentage of the 64 publications , using different choices for standard error \nclustering. No IFRS stud y conducted before 2008 used  clustered standard errors  in their main \nanalysis . However, this changed with the publication of a study by Petersen (2009), who shows that \nclustering of standard errors often results in better estimates of standard errors than a variety of \nalternative approaches, such as the Fama -MacBeth and Newey -West approaches.  In theory , the level \nat which observations are clustered for the computation of standard errors is a choice that should \ndepend on the covariance -variance matrix of the r esiduals. However, as  the covariance -variance \nmatrix is unobservable, researchers have to make relatively ad -hoc choices at the clustering level.   \nAs the majority of these studies conduct cross -country analys es, they suggest  that standard \nerrors should id eally be clustered at the country  level to address within -country correlation s in \nresiduals.  This preference to cluster at  the country  level is clearly noticeable in Figure 3, which shows \na significant increase in the number of publications using country -level clustering in recent years.  \nHowever, co untry -level clustering substantially limits the degrees of freedom to estimate standard \nerrors. Moreover, Petersen (2009) shows that the estimates of clustered standard errors may be  biased \nif the number  of clusters is lower  than 40. Thus the choice of clustering at the country  level may yield \nbiased standard errors unless there are enough countries in the sample.  \nResearchers considering  small sample s may consider  cluster ing using bootstrapped standard \nerrors (Cameron, Gelbach , and Miller 2008; Gow, Ormazabal, and Taylor 2010). Given the lack of \nclear theoretical guidance at the  clustering level and the  advantages and disadvantages to clustering at \ndifferent levels, it seems prudent to at least discuss th e sensitivity of inferences to various clustering \nchoices.  \n10.4.4.4. Measurement of control variables' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 86}
page_content='86 \n As discussed earlier, IFRS studies often include control variables in Equation (1) to account for \nheterogeneity in characteristics across treated and non-treated firms. These variables are  often  based \non reported financial statements ( such as total assets, book value of equity, book leverage, earnings), \nwhich themselves are altered by IFRS adoption. This may alter the quality of control variables \nbetwee n the pre - and post -IFRS periods and thereby influence the conclusions drawn from Equation \n(1). Although  few studies explicitly discuss this concern, it seems reasonable to allow the coefficients \nof the accounting -based control variables in Equation (1) to  vary between the pre- and post -adoption \nperiods and to test the sensitivity of results to including controls from only the pre -IFRS periods. The \nlatter approach would be problematic if the sample  characteristics were to significantly change \nbetween before  and after adoption . In such cases , a post-IFRS sample should ideally be restricted to \nthe period immediately following IFRS adoption  to mitigate the problem . \n10.5. Cross -sectional variation in the effects  of IFRS  \nTo corroborate an identification strategy and attribute observed changes in outcomes to IFRS \nadoption, studies conduct  cross -sectional tests that relate observed changes in outcomes to differences \nin accounting standards between IFRS and local GAAP.  These t ests are predicated on the notion that \nif observed changes in the dependent variable are caused by IFRS adoption, then the changes should \nbe related to the degree to which IFRS adoption alters the country’s accounting standards.  These tests \ntypically use t he Bae et al. (200 8) index to measure the difference between local GAAP and IFRS.  \nHowever, t he Bae et al. (200 8) index is a noisy measure of differences in accounting standards.  \nFirst, it is based on Nobes’ s (2001) GAAP survey, which compares local GAAP and IAS as of 2001.  \nHowever , since 2001, the local GAAP in a variety of countries and IAS/IFRS have evolved, including \nin the years before the EU’s large -scale adoption of IFRS in 2005.  For example, after the 2002 EU \nvote to adopt IFRS, several EU countries started modifying their domestic standards to both ease the \ntransition to IFRS and make financial statements more comparable across listed firms mandated to \nreport under IFRS and large unlisted firms using  domestic GAAP.  Therefore this measure may be  a \nnoisy measure of differences in accounting standards after 2001.  Second, the GAAP survey ignores \nthe differences that arise from alternative accounting choices available under one set of standards but \nnot the other. If IAS allow s multiple accounting choices but domestic rules allow only one of those \nalternatives or provide more detailed or restrictive standards, then these differences are not captured in \nthe GAAP survey and consequently  not captured  in the Bae et al. (200 8) index. Finally, the index is \ncalculat ed as a simple aggregation of the differences in 21 accounting rules that deal with the \nmeasurement, recognition, and disclosure of financial numbers. However, not all of these accounting \nrules are necessarily relevant in every context examined by IFRS studies. Thus studies that are \nprimarily focused on accounting recognition , for instance , may find disclosure differences reflected in \nthe index to add noise.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 87}
page_content='87 \n Some studies examine an  alternative cross -sectional prediction for the effects of IFRS : the \neffects should be stronger in countries with greater enforcement of IFRS rules.  This logic follows \nfrom the work of Ball et al. (2003)  and holds  that accounting standards per se play a li mited role in \naffecting firms’ financial reporting practices unless combined with proper enforcement. Studies \ngenerally confirm this relationship using the rule -of-law or security regulation ind ices (e.g., Byard et \nal. 2011; Daske et al. 2008) to measure t he strength of enforcement . However, Ball et al. (2015), who \nstudy changes in debt covenants around IFRS adoption, are an exception and do not find evidence to \nsupport the observation that  enforcement is related to  the effects of  IFRS. They interpret their  finding \nas evidence that the limitations of IFRS for debt contracting, such as  those  resulting from the fair \nvaluing of liabilities and the inclusion of transitory shocks in earnings, are not resolved by stronger \nenforcement.  \nMost of the IFRS studies that evaluat e the  cross -sectional differences caused by enforcement \ntend to interact or partition their sample s on the legal enforcement variable based on a study by La \nPorta et al. (1999) ( e.g., Leuz 2003; Burgstahler et al. 2006; Li 2010). This enforcement measure \ncaptures the efficiency of the judicial system, rule of law, and corruption. These measures notably \nappear to neglect any dimension of financial reporting  enforcement or auditing charac teristics. \nTherefore it is unclear whether these enforcement variables are capturing enforcement and the \nincentives related to financial reporting outcomes. Another common measure of enforcement is the \nrule-of-law index compiled by Kaufman et al. (2007). T heir measure is based on the views of private \nand public sector experts , citizens , and firms;  the extent to which they have confidence in and abide \nby the rules of society ; and the likelihood of crime and violence. Although  a dimension of this \nmeasure cove rs contract enforcement and property rights, it does not directly measure  financial \nreporting regulatory strength or capital market protections. It is unclear whether this construct reflect s \nthe enforcement that many studies purport  to capture . However,  it has been shown to yield the \nstrongest differential in IFRS benefits , adopted  in studies such as  those by  Daske et al. (2008), \nDeFond et al. (2011), and Li (2010).  \nSeveral studies use output measures of enforcement/implementation based on earnings quality \nscores before and after IFRS adoption. For instance, DeFond et al. (2011) measure credibility of \nimplementation as an earnings quality score developed by Leuz et al . (2003) , using outcomes to \nmeasure credibility  that implicitly account  for audit quality (given these are reported numbers). De \nGeorge (2015) also calcula tes country -level changes in reporting quality  scores as the post -IFRS -\nadoption earnings quality less the pre-adoption period score as a measure of the strength of \nimplementation.  \nKim et al . (2012) calcula te country -level measures of regulatory reforms using data from the \nAnnual Executive Opinion Survey conducted by the Inst itute for Management Development.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 88}
page_content='88 \n Although  its primary purpose is to provide quantifiable measures of management practices, labor \nrelations , and corruption, the survey explicitly asks respondents to evaluate the extent to which \nauditing and accounting prac tices are implemented in their firms adequately and the extent to which \ncorporate boards supervise company management effectively.  The authors measure changes in \nregulatory levels using the changes in these scores from the pre - to post-IFRS period s.   \nBrow n, Preiato, and Tarca (2014) argue that the current enforcement index used by the IFRS \nliterature is deficient for captur ing compliance with accounting standards. They instead propose  an \nindex measuring the quality of auditors’ working environment and the degree of accounting \nenforcement by independent enforcement bodies. They use data from the International Federation of \nAccounts, World Bank, and national secur ities regulators and calcula te three new indices for 51 \ncountries for 2002, 2005, and 2008.  Testi ng these new enforcement ind ices in the context of analyst \nforecasts , the authors  find that they have incremental power over  the rule-of-law index  in explaining \nanalyst forec ast errors and dispersion.  They conclude  that their enforcement ind ices are better at \ncapturing accounting enforcement than the traditionally used legal enforcement ind ices.   \nOverall, although  there are a variety of approaches are used to reflect  the impact of IFRS \nadoption and changes in enforcement, no one measure domina tes. The extent to which the broad rule -\nof-law proxies considered by  La Porta et al. (1999) and Kaufman et al. (2007) are relevant to \nunderstanding the enforcement of financial reports  remains unclear . The e vidence provided by  Brown \net al. (2014) suggest s that these proxies are unlikely to sufficient ly capture reporting enforcement. \nThere are also concerns surrounding  the current proxies for the accounting effects  of IFRS adoption . \nAttempts to identify accounting -specific enforcement proxies and measures of the effects  of IFRS on \nfinancial reports should provide  a fruitful  direction for future studies . \n \n11. Conclusion  \nSince the large -scale mandatory adoption of IFRS over 10 years ago, a number of research \nstudies have evaluated the effects of IFRS adoption. The early  studies understandably focus on the \ndirect effects of IFRS on reporting quality . In contrast to the findings reported based on voluntary \nIFRS adopters, studies of mandatory adopters provide, at best, mixed  evidence that adoption improve s \nthe quality  of accounting report s. However, this conclusion changes when one focus es on capita l-\nmarket -based proxies of reporting quality  or the capital market outcomes of IFRS a doption, such as \nstock liquidity, trading volume , or price  reactions to earnings announcements. There is strong \nevidence that capital market outcomes and proxies for reporting quality improve after IFRS  adoption , \nat least for some countries. However , resea rchers do not agree on whether the observed outcomes are' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 89}
page_content='89 \n attributable to IFRS adoption itself or to other institutional changes that occur concurrently with IFRS \nadoption.   \nAlthough  the evidence based on direct measures is mixed as to  whether IFRS adoption \nincreases comparability, studies based on capital market effects of comparability generally show  that \nadoption improve s comparability across countries. There is also convincing evidence that IFRS ha ve \ntriggered greater interest from foreign investors and foreign analysts, although  whether such increased \ninterest is of any benefit to domestic firms is unclear. Given that an oft -repeated objective of IFRS \nadoption by regulators has been the achievement of  financial reporting comparabili ty, researchers \nhave begun  paying more attention to better understand ing and measur ing comparability.  That said, \nsimply harmonizing accounting standards  does not appear to achieve full comparability in financial \nreporting . \nResearch into  the effects of IFRS adoption on contracting , stewardship , decision -making,  and \nauditing is still in its infancy. Very few studies conducted  in these areas  have been published,  and \neven when one considers the evidence in working papers, there is no clear under standing of how IFRS \nmatter  to contracting or stewardship  or how audit verification interacts with the use of IFRS numbers \nin contracts . For instance, although  almost all of the debt contracting studies document a decline in \naccounting -based covenants  following IFRS adoption, they offer contradictory interpretations . Some \nstudies argue  that the decline is caused by improved transparency under IFRS , whereas others suggest \nthat it is a result of  IFRS numbers being irrelevant for use in contracts. More research  is required  to \ndetermine  the causal mechanisms underlying the link between IFRS numbers and their use for \nstewardship and contracting. Nevertheless , the observed differences in IFRS outcomes for stock and \ndebt markets highlight the multidimensiona l effect of IFRS adoption on firms.  An accounting \nstandard that is developed to enhance the valuation role of accounting may not be optimal for \nstewardship or debt contracting purposes. A fruitful avenue for future research is to evaluate whether \nand how e ach attribute of IFRS affects  valuation, stew ardship , and contracting roles  differently . \nOne major obstacle to a proper cross -study comparison of IFRS results is the varied empirical \nchoices made by researchers. Although  some of these differences are driven by the nature of the \nquestion s examined, IFRS studies could do more to provide results that are based on a more consistent \nset of empirical methods.  Discussions and online appendices related to the  sensitivity of results to \nalternative empirical cho ices would be a step forward.  Many IFRS studies are also hindered by a lack \nof reliable international data. Although  some of these problems are institutional and cultural  and \nrequir e changes in the laws of many countrie s, we expect that some of these conce rns will decrease \nover time as better computing techniques for data collection become available.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 90}
page_content='90 \n Finally, although IFRS is now required for listed firms in many countries , several countries \npermit or even require private companies  also to adopt them . The need of p rivate firms  for financial \nreports differ s vastly  from that of listed firms, raising questions about whether requiring private firms \nto report under a relatively complex set of accounting standard s passes the cost -benefit test. Overall , \nalthough  the literature is making progress, research conducted across  a variety of dimensions is \nrequired before researchers can claim to have a decent understanding of the mechanisms based on  \nwhich IFRS affect the  various facets of a business.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/Xi_A_review_IFRS_adoption_literature_RAS 2016.pdf', 'page': 91}

page_content="107 \n TABLE 4 - IFRS adoption dates by country between 2001 and 2013  \nThis table presents the adoption dates by country for a broad sample of countries from 2001 through 2013. We report the date at which local regulators required the use of \nIFRS and the fiscal period end date at which the first annual reports were prepared in accordance with the IFRS mandate (base d on the majority of firms' year -ends in a given \ncountry). We obtain information about IFRS adoption dates from multiple  sources: PWC IFRS adoption reports (April 2013); the IASPlus website maintained by Deloitte; the \nIASB website; Adoptifrs.org, maintained by academics; and the websites of multiple local exchanges around the globe. Note tha t in the instances where the majo rity of firms \nwithin a country follow a non -December year -end (e.g., Australia) , we try to take that into account in the dates used in the “First IFRS annual report dates ” column.   \nCountry  Current GAAP  IFRS mandated \nfor fiscal \nperiods \nbeginning:  First IFRS \nannual report \ndates (FPE)  Notes on country -level adoption (where relevant).  \nIFRS adopting countries   \nAlbania  IFRS (a) 01-Jan-08 31-Dec-08 Requirement that all listed, large unlisted,  and financial institutions prepare \ntheir legal entity and consolidated reports under IFRS .  \n \nArgentina  IFRS (a) 01-Jan-12 31-Dec-12 Requirement that all entities whose securities are listed and are regulated by the \nCNV adopt IFRS as adopted by IASB. Voluntary adoption allowable from Jan . \n1, 2011. Exception: Banks and Insurance Companies. On Feb . 12, 2014 , the \nBCRA issued Communication A5541 announcing a plan to converge the BCRA \naccounting standards for banks with IFRS. The converged standards will \nbecome mandatory on Jan . 1, 2018.  \n \nAustralia  IFRS  01-Jan-05 31-Dec-05 Requirement that all listed and unlisted (private) firms adopt  IFRS.  Given IFRS \nneed to be incorporated into Australian law they are issued as “Australian \nAccounting Standards” although  entities effectively adopt IFRS word -for-word . \nNote that virtually no voluntary adoption was allowabl e in Australia before the \nmandate. Researchers should also be aware that as the majority of Australian \ncompanies report June 30 year -ends (over 85% of listed firms) . The first date at \nwhich the majority of annual IFRS compliant financial statements were issued \nis the fiscal period ending Jun . 30, 2006   \n \nAustria  IFRS (c) 01-Jan-05 31-Dec-05 In addition to the requirements of the EU IFRS mandate (i.e., mandatory  \nadoption for consolidated accounts of entities listed on EU regulated markets), \nAustria allowed voluntary IFRS adoption for firms not listed on regulated \nexchanges.

page_content='2 \n Executive Summary  \n1. An objective of Australia’s financial reporting system, as stated in Part 12 of the \nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 , is to facilitate the \nAustralian economy by reducing the cost of capital.  As the Australian Accounting \nStandards Board (AASB) is a government agency within Australia ’s financial reporting \nsystem, it follows that a statutory function of the AASB is to make  or formulate \naccounting standards t hat reduce the cost of capital . This report examines the various \nways cost of capital is  estimated in both real -world practice and academic literature and  \napplies  a subset of these estimates to investigate the associatio n between cost of capital \nand accounting standard -setting in Australia . \n \n2. We conduct a review of the cost of capital literature and focus on the construct and \napplication of the implied cost of equity capital in an Australian setting.  The construct \nof the implied cost of equity capital is centred around determining the anticipated rate \nof return inferred from market prices, condensed accounting figures, and projections of \nearnings and dividends. The expected rate of return is commonly u sed as a substitute \nfor the cost of equity capital and is determined by inverting valuation models that rely \non accounting data.  \n \n3. We construct the implied cost of equity capital for firms listed on the Australian Stock \nExchange (ASX) over the period 1995 -2021. Next, we investigate the change , if any, \nin cost of equity capital following the implementation  of A ASB 15 Revenue from \nContracts with Customers  (AASB 15) and AASB 16 Leases  (AASB 16) . Focusing on \na sample period from 2015 -2020, we document some evidence of lower average cost \nof equity capital for Australian firms  post AASB 15 and AASB 16  implementation . We \nalso discuss the use of industry classification s and textual analysis to identify firms \nmore likely to be impacted by the intro duction of AASB 15 and AASB 16, and find \nsome evidence of stronger cost of capital effects for these firms.  Caveats related to our \nfindings are discussed.  \n \n4. We next discuss various alternative methods to estimate the cost of capital for firms in \nAustralia.  These include bond yield, bank loan spread, interest paid on borrowings, \nseasoned equity offering discount, stock liquidity, analyst forecast accuracy and \ndisagreement.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 1}

page_content='4 \n 1. Introduction  \nPart 12 of the Australian Securities and Investment Commiss ion Act 2001  (the ASIC \nAct) governs Australia’s financial reporting system. One objective of Part 12, as stated in \nSection 224(b)(i) of the ASIC Act , is for the Australian financial reporting syste m to facilitate \nthe Australian economy by reducing the cost of capital. The Australian Accounting Standards \nBoard (AASB) is established un der Part 12 of the ASIC Act as a  government  agency within \nAustralia’s financial reporting system.  Section 227 of the ASIC Act outlines the statutory \nfunctions of the AASB, one of which is to advance and promote the main objects of Part 12.1 \nIt is evident, therefore, that a function of the AASB is to make or formulate accounting \nstandards which facilit ate the Australian economy by reducing the cost of capital.2    \nIn light of the above, the purpose of this report is twofold. First, to provide an overview \nof the literature on , and models used to estimate , cost of capital, as well as recommendations \non th ose models most suitable for the AASB to assess its satisfaction of the abovementioned  \nstatutory function. Second,  informed by these recommendations , we examine the change in \ncost of equity capital for a sample of Australian Stock Exchange -listed companies following \nthe introduction of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  and AASB 16 Leases . \nWe find an average reduction in cost of equity capital of 103 to 190 basis points for our sample \ncompanies , depending on model specification. We, however, acknowledge and outline several \ncaveats when interpreting these findings.  \nThe report is structured as follows. Section 2 provides background information on the \ncost of capital. In particular, it defines cost of capital, discusses the traditional  models used to \nestimate cost of capital,  including strengths and limitations , and the models we decide upon to \nestimate cost of capital in our setting. Section 2 then reviews literature  demonstrating the \ntheoretical and empirical  association be tween accounting standards and cost of capital. Section \n3 discusses our sample selection process and the descriptive statistics  of our sample firms. \nSection 4 discusses the findings of our regression analys es on the association between the \nintroduction of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  and AASB 16 Leases  and \ncost of equity capital for our sample firms. Caveats  related to our findings are outlined  in \nSection 4. Section 5 provides a discussion of a range of alternative proxies of cost of capita l, \nincluding cost of equity and cost of debt, that may to estimate the association between \n                                                           \n1 ASIC Act, Part 12, Section 227(1)(e).  \n2 As further support, Section 228 of the ASIC Act states that in interpreting an accounting standard formulated by \nthe AASB, a construction that would promote the objectives of Part 12 is preferred over one that would not.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 3}
page_content='5 \n accounting standards and cost of capital . Conclusions and recommendations are provided in \nSection 6.       \n2. A primer on the cost of capital  \nThe cost of capital is a fundamental concept in accounting and finance that refers to the \nminimum rate of return that investors require to invest in a company or project  (Ross et al., \n2019) . It represents the opportunity cost of investing in one project ov er another and is an \nimportant consideration in financial decision -making. The cost of capital is comprised of two \ncomponents: the cost of debt capital and the cost of equity  capital . The cost of debt capital is \nthe interest rate that a n entity  pays on its  outstanding debt, while the cost of equity capital \nrepresents the return required by investors in exchange for the risk of investing in the company  \n(Ross et al., 2019) . \nSeveral models have been developed to determine the cost of capital, each with its \nstrengths and weaknesses. For example, the CAPM and the Fama -French five -factor model are \ntwo popular methods for estimating the cost of equity capital. The CAPM assumes tha t \ninvestors require a risk premium above the risk -free rate to compensate for the systematic risk \nassociated with investing in a particular security or portfolio. The risk premium is calculated \nby multiplying the market risk premium by the security’s beta,  which measures the systematic \nrisk of the security relative to the market. The market risk premium is the excess return \ninvestors require for holding a risky asset over the risk -free rate of return. However, the CAPM \nhas been critici sed for its simplicity  and for the fact that it assumes a linear relationship between \nreturns and risk (Pástor et al., 2008)  and its reliance on historical data as inputs to estimate a \nforward -looking measure (Jackson and Plumlee, 2023) . \nThe Fama -French five -factor model (Fam a and French, 2015) is a more complex model \nwhich builds on the CAPM by including additional factors that affect the expected returns of \nstocks. These factors include size, value, profitability, investment, and momentum.3 The Fama -\nFrench five -factor model ha s been found to explain more of the cross -sectional variation in \nexpected returns than the CAPM, but it is also critici sed for its complexity and the difficulty of \n                                                           \n3 The size factor reflects the ob servation that smaller firms tend to have higher returns than larger firms, while the \nvalue factor reflects the observation that value stocks (i.e., stocks with low price -to-book ratios) tend to have \nhigher returns than growth stocks (i.e., stocks with hig h price -to-book ratios). The profitability factor reflects the \nobservation that more profitable firms tend to have higher returns, while the investment factor reflects the \nobservation that firms that invest more tend to have lower returns. The momentum fac tor reflects the observation \nthat stocks with positive returns in the recent past tend to have higher returns in the future.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 4}
page_content="6 \n estimating some of the risk factors accurately (Jackson and Plumlee, 2023; Chattopadhyay  et \nal., 2016).  \nBoth the CAPM and the five -factor model are widely used in practice to estimate the \ncost of equity. However, there is ongoing debate about which model is more appropriate and \nwhether either model provides an accurate estimate of the cost of equ ity in all circumstances \n(Pástor et al., 2008). Some researchers have proposed alternative models that incorporate \nadditional factors or use different methods to estimate the cost of equity, but there is no \nconsensus on the best approach (see, for example,  Damodaran, 2016). 4  \n2.1 The implied cost of equity capital  \nThe emergence of the residual income valuation model reintroduced by Ohlson (1995 ), \nalong with the abnormal growth in earnings model developed by Ohlson and Juettner -Nauroth \n(2005), has been the driving force behind a growing empirical literature that utili ses these \nmodels in reverse to deduce the market's expectations of equity capital's rate of return. This \napproach has the significant advantage of utili sing forecasts, as opposed to solely extra polating \nfrom historical data, and has replaced the reliance on historical data -based estimates, as \nestimated through methods like the CAPM .  \nThe implied cost of equity is a measure of the cost of equity capital that is based on \nmarket prices. Specifically, it is the rate of return that investors expect to earn on a stock, as \nimplied by the stock ’s current market price and analysts ’ earnings forecasts.  To estimate the \nimplied cost of equity, researchers  typically use a variation of the Gordon and Shapiro (1956) \ngrowth model, which relates the expected dividend yield and the expected long -term growth \nrate of a company's earnings per share to its stock price. By solving for the implied cost of \nequity, researchers  can determine the rate of return th at the market expects to earn on a \nparticular firm. \nThis report mostly focuses on the implied cost of equity as a measure of the cost of \ncapital because it is a widely used and accepted method for estimating the cost of equity.5 The \n                                                           \n4 Other commonly used models include the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) and the Weighted Average Cost of \nCapital (WACC) model. The D DM is a model that calculates the value of a company's equity by discounting the \nexpected future dividends, including a terminal value, at a rate that reflects the risk of investing in the company. \nThe WACC model considers the cost of both debt and equity and calculates a weighted average cost of capital \nthat reflects the overall risk of investing in the company whether via debt or equity . For a more detailed discussion \nof these and other related models see Jackson and Plumlee (2023) and Ross et al . (2019).   \n5 The implied cost of equity can be a useful measure of a company ’s cost of equity capital because it is based on \nactual market data and reflects the expectations of investors. Other models, such as the CAPM, rely on historical \ndata as inputs, which is a  limitation of these models given the cost of equity capital is a forward -looking measure." metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 5}
page_content="7 \n implied cost of equity is derived from market data and reflects the expectations of market \nparticipants regarding the future performance of the company. It assumes  that investors require \na return that compensates them for the risk they are taking by invest ing in the company ’s \nequity.6 Additionally, the implied cost of equity is considered to be a forward -looking measure, \nas it reflects the market's expectation of future returns. This makes it a useful tool for companies \nthat are planning to raise equity cap ital in the near future, as it provides an estimate of the return \ninvestors will require  (Easton, 200 4). Finally, the implied cost of equity is relatively easy to \ncalculate and interpret, making it a convenient measure for both practitioners and researcher s \n(Easton, 200 7). \n2.1.1 Model estimation  \nWe estimate implied  cost of equity capital for a firm in a particular month by calculating \nthe discount rate or internal rate of return that makes the market value of its assets equal to the \npresent value of expected future cash flows. We use four models , developed by Claus and \nThomas (2001), Gebhardt et al. (2001), Gode and Mohanram (2003), and Easton (2004) , to \nestimate the implied cost of equity capital. We also use a composite measure of implied cost \nof equity capital, which is the average of the four estimates, to ensure  that our results are not \ninfluenced by any particular model's assumptions.  \nAll four models rely on analysts ’ earnings forecasts to estimate cash flow expectations, \nbut to overcome the limitations associated with reliance on analysts’ earnings forecasts, we use \na pooled cross -sectional model developed by Hou et al. (2012) to forecast earnings for \nindividual firms. This model captures a significant amount of the variation in earnings \nperformance across firms and produces accurate earnings forecasts similar to consensus analyst \nforecasts. For more information on our estimation procedure, please refer to Appendix A.  \n \n                                                           \nRelying on historical data to estimate a forward -looking measure assumes that past patterns will continue into the \nfuture, which is unlikely. There are also, h owever , limitations  associated with measures of implied cost of equity . \nFor example, it assumes that the current market price of a stock is an accurate reflection of its intrinsic value, \nwhich may not always be the case. Additionally, the implied cost of equity can be sensitive to short -term \nfluctuations in a company's stock price, which may not necessarily reflect its long -term risk profile.  Overall, the \nimplied cost of equity can be a useful complement to other methods for estimating the cost of equity, such as  the \nCAPM or the Fama -French five -factor model but should not be relied upon as the sole measure of a company ’s \ncost of equity capital.  \n6 Pástor et al. (2008) discuss the difference between expected and reali sed returns and advocate the use of the \nimplied cost of equity capital as a superior proxy for expected returns. They offer theoretical underpinnings for \nthe value of the implied cost of equity capital in uncovering the intertemporal risk –return relation." metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 6}
page_content="8 \n 2.2 Theoretical motivation  on the impact of accounting standard s on the cost of capital  \nTheoretical predictions suggest that accounting information quality can impact both \nliquidity and cost of capital through two mechanisms: estimation risk and information \nasymmetry. Estimation risk refers to the uncertainty associated with investors ’ assessments of \nan asset ’s return, while information as ymmetry relates to the risk that liquidity traders face \nfrom potentially trading with better -informed investors  (Barry and Brown, 1985; Easley and \nO’Hara, 2004) . Increasing the amount and precision of accounting disclosures can lower \nestimation risk and re sult in convergent opinions among investors, which improves risk sharing \nand decreases the cost of capital.  \nStudies show that investors prefer securities with more information available, and firms \nwith better information have lower costs of capital.7 Information asymmetry can introduce \nadverse selection into share markets and decrease liquidity, leading to increased costs of \ncapital. However, firms can decrease this cost by improving the level or precision of \ndisclosures, which lowers the degree of informa tion asymmetry between investors and \neventually the cost of capital  (Lambert et al., 2007) . Greater disclosures can also mitigate \ninvestor concerns about taking large stakes in a firm, increasing demand for securities,  and \ndecreasing the cost of capital  (Lambert et al., 2007) .8 \n                                                           \n7 According to Barry and Brown ’s (1985) Bayesian  model, investors who are risk -averse tend to favour securities \nthat have greater availability of information. This is because these securities are associated with lower estimation \nrisk, making them a more desirable option for investors.  Easley and O ’Hara (2004) propose a model wherein \ncompanies that possess more private information and less public information are at a greater risk of information \nuncertainty, leading to higher expected returns.  Lambert et al. (2007) develop a  model in which the quality of \naccounting information can affect the cost of equity capital .  \n8 Congruent with these theoretical predictions, accounting standards practically  affect an entity’s cost of capital \nvia their effect on the entity’s financial reporting practices. Here are some ways in which accounting standards \ncan affect the cost of capital  in a practical sense.  Transparency and comparability : Accounting standards help \nensure that financial statements are transparent and comparable across companies , which make s it easier for \ninvestors to assess a company's financial health and make informed investment decisions. Greater transparency \nand comparability reduce information asymmetry and , ultimately , lower cost of capital. Financial metrics : \nAccounting standards can affect financial metrics such as earnings, net income, and cash flow. Changes in these \nmetrics can affect the valuation of a company and , thus, the cost of capital. Investor perception s: Accounting \nstandards can also affect investor perception s of a company’s financial hea lth and prospects. For example, changes \nin accounting standards may lead to changes in reported earnings or cash flows, which could be perceived as \npositive or negative by investors depending on the circumstances. These perceptions can impact the cost of c apital. \nCompliance costs : Complying with accounting standards can be costly for companies, particularly if the \naccounting standards necessitate  changes to accounting systems and processes. These compliance costs can \nincrease a company’s operating expenses,  which may, in turn,  increase the cost of capital. Regulatory compliance : \nFailure to comply with accounting standards can result in penalties and other regulatory actions, which can \nincrease the perceived risk of investing in a company and , consequently,  raise the cost of capital. Overall, the \nimpact of accounting standards on the cost of capital will depend on a variety of factors, including the nature of \nthe standards, the size and complexity of the company, and the perceptions of investors and regulators ." metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 7}
page_content="9 \n 2.3 Empirical evidence on the impact of accounting standard s on the cost of capital  \nDaske (2006) provides some of the earliest evidence of the link between the choice of \naccounting standards and cost of capital estimates. Using an alyst consensus forecasts from  the \nInstitutional Brokers’ Estimate System  (IBES ) database , Daske (2006) estimates the implied \ncost of equity capital for a sample of German firms between 1993 and 2002 and finds no \nevidence to suggest that it is lower for firms reporting under I nternational Accounting \nStandards (IAS)  or US GAAP than for firms reporting under German GAAP. In fact, he finds \nthat the cost of equity increases when firms switch from local GAAP to IAS or US GAAP, \nwhich he suggests  may reflect the  effects of the decreased comparability of these firms’ \nfinancial reports relative to those of other German firms.9  \nRecogni sing that firms have discretion in how they implement new accounting \nstandards, Daske et al.  (2013) re -examine the observed liquidit y and cost of capital effects \naround voluntary (and mandatory) adoption. Their analysis incorporates changes in firm -level \nreporting incentives and behavio ur around the time of adoption to classify firms as either \n“serious” or “label” adopters.  The authors  study voluntary adopters of IAS between 1990 and \n2005, spanning 30 countries. They find that there were no significant effects on liquidity or \ncost of capital estimates for voluntary adopters when compared to local -GAAP firms or a firm's \nown pre -IAS histo ry. However, when they factor in concurrent changes in reporting incentives, \nthey discover that “serious ” adopters experienced improvements in liquidity and reductions in \ncost of capital relative to “label ” adopters.10 \nDaske et al. (2008) conduct a study using panel data on mandatory I nternational \nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  adopters from 26 countries to examine the impact of \nmandatory IFRS adoption on stock liquidity, cost of capital, and Tobin ’s Q. They find that \n                                                           \n9 Leuz and Verrecchia (2000) compare proxies for stock liquidity, namely bid -ask spread, trading volume, and \nreturn volatility, across German firms that voluntarily report under either IAS or US GAAP versus those reporting \nunder local German GAAP. They find that firms reporting their financial reports under IAS or US GAAP exhibit \nlower bid -ask spreads and higher share turnovers but not different share price volatilities. Leuz (2003) finds \ninsignificant differences in the bid -ask spreads and share turnove r between the two groups, indicating that the \nmere adoption of either IAS or US GAAP is not sufficient to improve these firms’ reporting quality relative to \neach other. In a closely related work, Bartov et al. (2005) study how the value relevance of accoun ting numbers \nvaries across German firms reporting under IAS, US GAAP, or German GAAP. Although they find that firms \nreporting under US GAAP or IAS have better value relevance, they do not find any significant difference in value \nrelevance between firms rep orting under US GAAP and IAS. Their findings, along with those of Leuz (2003), \nindicate minimal stock market benefits from adopting IFRS relative to US GAAP.  \n10 There is a mixed body of evidence regarding voluntary adoption. While some studies have found that voluntary \nIFRS adoption can lead to a decrease in information asymmetry and stock liquidity, other studies have not found \nsupport for the idea that voluntar y adoption alone improves liquidity or reduces cost of capital. This evidence \nsuggests that the impact of voluntary IFRS adoption may be more nuanced than previously thought." metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 8}

However, when examining the effects in the year before \nIFRS adoption, they find that cost of capital decreased and Tobin ’s Q increased, suggesting \nthat the benefi ts of IFRS may be reflected in stock prices before the adoption. The study also \nfinds that the observed benefits occurred only in countries with strict enforcement regimes and \nwhere firms have incentives to be transparent. Li (2010) investigates the effect  of mandatory \nadoption of IFRS on the cost of equity capital and document that mandatory adopters enjoy a \nsignificant reduction in their cost of equity.11, 12 \nKim et al. (2011) propose that if we assume financial reports under IFRS are of better \nquality compared to those prepared under local GAAP from a debt holder’s viewpoint, then \nthe adoption of IFRS can lead to a decrease in the ex -ante information risk face d by lenders \nand also lower ex -post monitoring and recontracting costs. They also highlight that the \nadoption of IFRS can enhance coordination between borrowers and lenders with respect to \ncapital investment decisions. Based on these potential advantages, Kim et al. (2011) argue that \ncompanies voluntarily adopting IFRS should have lower debt costs. To test this prediction, they \nexamine a sample of syndicated loans issued between 1997 and 2005 in 40 countries. They \ndiscover that IFRS adopters pay lower inter est rates, receive loans with longer maturities, \nobtain larger loan amounts, are less likely to have restrictive covenants, and attract more \nforeign lenders compared to non -IFRS adopters.  \nChen et al. (2015) investigate the impact of mandatory IFRS adoptio n on syndicated \nloans and provide a different perspective from the previous research on voluntary adopters. \nThey suggest that mandating IFRS can either increase or decrease the information asymmetry \nbetween lenders and borrowers, depending on whether debth olders perceive IFRS to be of \nbetter quality than local GAAP. To test their hypothesis, they examine syndicated bank loans \n                                                           \n11 Platikanova and Perramon (2012) study how new information revealed through IFRS  adoption relates to stock \nliquidity and document that net income differences reflect greater uncertainty about IFRS adjustments in the \ntransition year, which lowers stock liquidity. Christensen et al. (2013) re -evaluate the evidence provided by Daske \net al. (2008) after accounting for concurrent enforcement and regulatory changes with mandatory IFRS adoption \nin some EU countries and find that the effects of IFRS introduction on stock liquidity are limited to five European \ncountries undergoing concurrent ch anges in enforcement.  \n12 Persakis and Iatridis (2017) study the adoption of IFRS among firms from European and Asian countries and \ndocument that after the adoption of IFRS, the cost of capital decrease s for firms in both regions. However, this \nonly occurred  for companies located in countries with stronger investor protection and for firms with higher \nquality earnings.  Hong et al. (2014) investigate how the adoption of IFRS impacts the cost of equity in the context \nof initial public offerings (IPOs). The auth ors propose that the enhanced disclosure and comparability resulting \nfrom IFRS adoption reduces the need to under -price IPOs due to a decrease in information asymmetry and \nuncertainties associated with equity issues.

However, \nthese benefits have not been universal and have only been observed in companies and countries \nwith specific changes in reporting incentives and enforcement. There are concerns about the \ncause of these effects, particu larly for studies on mandatory IFRS adoption.  \n2.4 Empirical evidence on the impact of accounting standard s on the cost of capital in Australia \nand New Zealand  \nSaha and Bose  (2021) investigate how the disclosure requirements of IFRS impact the \ncost of capital for a group of Australian companies. Their  results indicate that there is a negative \nrelationship between these disclosure requirements and the cost of capital, suggesting tha t \ncompanies with higher levels of IFRS disclosure tend to have lower capital costs.13 \nFurthermore, they also document  that IFRS disclosure requirements are linked to lower costs \nof both debt and equity capital.  \nHoque et al . (2016) examine how the adoption of IFRS by New Zealand -listed \ncompanies affects the cost of equity capital. The y document a significant negative correlation \nbetween the adoption of IFRS and the cost of equity capital. The results suggest that IFRS is a \nhigher quality set of accounting st andards than pre -IFRS New Zealand GAAP. The study \nsupports previous research on European companies and highlights the potential benefits of \nIFRS adoption for companies in countries such as the U nited States  and Japan that have yet to \nadopt IFRS.   \nWhile the  above studies focus on IFRS adoption holistically, whether voluntary or \nmandatory, our focus is on the introduction of specific IFRS in Australia for several reasons. \nFirst, mandatory IFRS adoption in Australia was in 2005, meaning any empirical evidence of \n                                                           \n13 Saha and Bose (2021)  use 157 Australian firms to examine how a specific set of IFRS disclosure requirements \nis associated with the overall cost of capital. These authors  create an IFRS disclosure in dex that includes 24 items \nfrom eight standards to measure the level of IFRS disclosure required. They then  chose to focus on the year 2012 \nto gain insight into the reporting practices of firms prior to changes resulting from the IASB's Disclosure Initiati ve \nProject and the release of the “Losing the excess baggage ” report in 2011.  The cost of  equity measures are \nestimated using two different models: the abnormal growth in earnings valuation model  of Easton (2004) and the \nunrestricted abnormal earnings growth model of Ohlson and Juettner -Nauroth (2005). The cost of debt capital is \nthe interest rate paid by the firm on total debts. They  find that IFRS disclosure requirements have a negative \nassociation with the overall cost  of capital ." metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 10}
page_content='12 \n the association between accounting standards and cost of capital would be dated. Instead, we \nfocus on two recently introduced IFRS in Australia, namely IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts \nwith Customers  (IFRS 15) and IFRS 16 Leases  (IFRS 16) . Second, we focus on these two \naccounting standards given the anticipated real effects of these two standards on entities and \ninvestors. The effects of IFRS 15 are far reaching, as acknowledged by the International \nAccounting Standards Board (IASB) in IFR S 15 Basis for Conclusions, given its application \nto a wide range of transactions and industries (para. BC3). In providing a robust, \ncomprehensive revenue recognition model, the IASB foresaw IFRS 15 would eliminate the \nprevious diversity in practice and cr eate greater comparability across entities, industries and \nreporting periods, resulting in a significant benefit to users (para. BC438) by enabling them to \nmake more informed economic decisions (para. BC439). These benefits extend to informed \ninvestment de cisions by investors. In its effects analysis of IFRS 16, the IASB  anticipated that \nIFRS 16 would affect the amounts reported by almost half of listed companies globally, have \na significant effect on key financial metrics, and due to improved quality of fi nancial reporting \nand improved comparability  of financial information facilitate better investment decision -\nmaking by investors (IASB, 2016).             \n \n3.

We match ASX -listed companies  with Globa l \nCompustat  financial statement data and lag annual accounting information by six months to \nensure that the information is publicly available to market participants (Ball et al., 2016). For \nexample, if a firm’s fiscal year ends in December, accounting info rmation is assumed to be \npublic by the end of the following June. The intersection of the Global Compustat Security \nDaily  and Global Compustat Financial results in a sample of 6,791 firm-year observations \nbetween 1995 and 20 21.14 Consistent with Jackson and Plumlee (2023), we acknowledge that \nour final sample represents only a subset of all ASX -listed companies . \n                                                           \n14 We employ a list of variables to control for the effects of other known determinants  of the cost of equity capital  \n(Dhaliwal., 2016) . Specifically, we control for the size effect by including SIZE (measured as the natural logarithm \nof a firm’s market capitalization). W e also include market -to-book ratio ( MB) to control for undervalued stocks \nas Gebhardt et al. (2001)  argue that undervalued stocks (low MB) should earn an abnormally high implied risk \npremium until the mispricing is corrected. We include leverage ( LEV) as the ratio of long -term debt over equity \nto control for the effect of financial leverage on the cost of equi ty capital.

In Panel A of Table \n1, we  report the summary statistics for five different implied cost of equity measures including \n𝑟𝐺𝑀 (based on the Gode and Mohanram (2003) and Ohden and Juettner -Nauroth (2005)  \nmethod), 𝑟𝐶𝑇 (based on the Claus and Thomas (2001) method), 𝑟𝐺𝐿𝑆 (based on the Gebhardt et \nal. (2001) method), 𝑟𝐸𝐴𝑆𝑇 (based on the Easton (2004) method) and 𝑟𝐴𝑉𝐸 (the average estimate \nof the aforementioned four measures). The average of 𝑟𝐴𝑉𝐸 is 8.86% and the median is 6.62%. \nWe also notice that the Easton (2004) method generates the highest average estimated cost of \nequity with a mean of 15.31%, and the Gode and Mohanram (2003) method produces the \nlowest average estimated cost of equity with a mean of 6.13%. In general, estimates of the cost \nof equity capit al are lower in our sample than those reported for larger U.S. samples in other \nstudies (see, for example, Hou et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2015; Dhaliwal et al., 2016).  \n{INSERT TABLE 1}  \nPanel B of Table 1 presents the pairwise correlations between the five estimates, which \nare all positive. The lowest observed correlation is between the Claus and Thomas (2001) ( 𝑟𝐶𝑇) \nand the Easton (2004) ( 𝑟𝐸𝐴𝑆𝑇) methods with a value of 0.3461. The highest observed correlation \nis between the Claus and Thomas method (2 001) ( 𝑟𝐶𝑇) and the Gode and Mohanram method \n(2003) ( 𝑟𝐺𝑀) with a value of 0.6951. These positive correlations suggest general agreement \namong the models.  \nPanel A of Table 2 presents summary statistics for firm characteristics. The average \nnatural loga rithm of firm size in the sample is 6.873 (or around 966 million dollars) and the \nmedian natural logarithm of firm size is 6.721 (or around 830 million dollars). Thus, there is \nno skewness in firm size as often seen in other studies. Other summary statisti cs indicate that \nthe sample firms on average have a market -to-book ratio ( MB) of 7.186 and leverage ( LEV) of \n19.5%. The average return on assets ( ROA ) is 6.4%. The average stock return in the past 12 \nmonths ( MOM ) is 21.1% and the average volatility ( VOL ) is 3.7%.  \nPanel B of Table 2 presents the correlation matrix for 𝑟𝐴𝑉𝐸 and firm characteristics. \nThese correlations suggest that the construct of the implied cost of equity capital is mostly \nintuitively consistent with the risk -return relationship.

There is an inverse \nrelation between 𝑟𝐴𝑉𝐸 and leverage ( LEV), which is not consistent with the notion that higher \nfinancial leverage leading  to higher equity risk. While 𝑟𝐴𝑉𝐸 is negatively correlated with return \non assets and volatility, the correlations are statistically insignificant.  \n{INSERT TABLE 2}  \n4. AASB 15 Revenue  from Contracts with Customers  and AASB 16 Lease s and the ir impact \non the cost of capital  \n4.1 AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  \nAustralia adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (IFRS 15) , the \nAustralian equivalent being AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (AASB 15),  on \nJanuary 1, 2018 , and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after this date . \nAASB 15  replace s previous revenue recognition standard s and introduced significant changes \nto the way revenue is recogni sed and then reported in financial statements.  With the aim of \nimproving the financial reporting of revenue, the IASB stated IFRS 15  was needed for several \nreasons. First, the previous revenue standards had different principles and were sometimes \ndifficult to understand and apply to complex  transactions. Second , there was  limited guidance \non important topics such as revenue recognition for multiple -element arrangements  under \nprevious revenue standards. Third, the disclosures required under previous revenue standards \nwere inadequate and often  did not provide financial statement users with information to \nsufficiently understand revenue arising from contracts with customer s (IASB , 2014, para.  \nBC2).   \nAASB 15 provides a comprehensive revenue recognition model that applies  to a wide \nrange of transactions and industries  and improves the financial reporting of revenue by , \namongst other things : (a) providing a robust framework for addressing revenue recognition; (b) \nimproving comparability of revenue recognition practices acro ss entities, industries, \njurisdictions and capital markets; (c) simplifying the preparation of financial statement \npreparation by reducing the amount of guidance to which entities must refer; and ( d) requiring \nenhanced disclosures to assist financial statements users better understand the nature, amount, \ntiming and uncertainty of revenue that is recognised  (IASB, 2014, para. BC3).  AASB 15 \nintroduces a five -step model to recognise revenue , requiring entities to : (1) identify the contract \nwith customers,  if any; (2) identify the separate performance obligations within the contract; \n(3) determine the transaction price of the contract; (4) allocate the transaction price to the' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 13}
page_content='15 \n performance obligations; and (5) recognise revenue upon the satisfaction of perfo rmance \nobligations.   \nThe introduction  of AASB 15  required entities to review their existing revenue \nrecognition policies and assess the financial reporting impact  of policy changes required under \nAASB 15 . To do so involved applying the five -step revenue recognition model outlined above, \nincluding reviewing existing contracts to determine if they fell within the scope of AASB 15 \nand, if so, assessing the timing and amount of revenue recognised in accordance with AASB \n15 (Dave rn et al., 2018).  \nAs outlined above, t he intended benefits of AASB 15 include reduced diversity in \nrevenue recognition practices, simplified financial statement preparation and improved \ntransparency due to due enhanced disclosure requirements. T he adoption of AASB 15, \nhowever,  has also imposed both implementation and ongoing costs on preparers . For example, \nthe IASB identified the following costs likely to be incurred by preparers: (a) costs to \nimplement and maintain changes in or develop new systems, processes and controls used to \ngather and archive contract data, make required estimates and provide required disclosures ; (b) \nadditional personnel costs; (c) increased audit fees; and (d) costs to educate staff and financial \nstatement users about  the effects o f AASB 15 on the financial statements ( IASB, 2014, para. \nBC486-487).  \nOverall, AASB 15  has had a significant impact on financial reporting practices for \nentities , with both benefits and challenges. The intended benefit s of AASB 15  include  greater \nfinancial statement comparability and transparency . Clear and transparent financial reporting \ncan improve investor confidence, which can lead to lower perceived risk and cost of capital. \nHowever, the compliance costs imposed on entities , whether in  the form of implementation or \nongoing costs, increase an entity’s operating expenses and may have an opposi ng effect  on an \nentity’s cost of capital , particularly  to the extent these firm -specific costs exceed the firm -\nspecific benefits derived from AASB 15. As such , it is difficult  to predict the impact of AASB \n15 on a firm’s  cost of capital.  \n4.2 AASB 16 Leases  \nAustralia adopted IFRS 16 Leases , the Australian equivalent being AASB 16 Leases  \n(AASB 16), on January 1, 2019, and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or \nafter this date . AASB 16  replace s the previous lease s standard, AASB 117 Leases , and \nintroduced significant changes to the way lessees account  for leases  in their financial' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 14}
page_content='16 \n statements. Previously, under AASB 117 lessees and lessors were required to classify their \nleases as either finance leases or operating leases and to account for those two types of leases \ndifferently , with lessees not required to recognise assets and liabilities arising from operating \nleases . This dual  model of accoun ting for leases from a lessee ’s perspective was criticised for \nnot meeting the needs of financial statement users as follows. First, information disclosed about \noperating lease commitments lacked transparency, with some  financial statement users \nadjusting a lessee’s  financial statements to capitalise operating leases. Other users, however, \nlacked the skillset to make such adjustments, thereby creating information asymmetry in the \nmarket . Second,  the existence of differen t accounting treatments for operating and finance \nleases  resulted in economically similar transactions were accounted for differently, thereby \nreducing financial statement comparability and enabling opportunistic accounting policy  \nchoice ( IASB, 201 6b, para. , BC3).     \nUnder AASB 16, a single lease model applies for lessees whereby a lessee is required \nto recognise a right -of-use asset and lease liabilit y for all leases with a term of more than 12 \nmonths and for which the underlying asset is not of low value. Impacting the financial ratios \nand performance indicators of those lessees that previously accounted for their leases as \noperating  leases, the IASB c oncluded that such an approach will result in greater financial \nstatement comparability, a more faithful representation of a lessee’s assets and liabilities and, \ntogether with enhanced disclosures, greater transparency of a lessee’s financial leverage and \ncapital employed  (IASB, 201 6b, para. , BC4).  The dual model of accounting for leases was \nretained for lessors.   \nThe impact of AASB 16 on the cost of capital for Australian entities  depend s on several \nfactors, including whether the lease was previously classified as an operating or finance lease, \nthe size of the lease obligations , and the nature of the industry in which the firm operates. On \nthe one hand, AASB 16 requires entities  to recogni se right of use assets and lease liabilities, \nwhich increases their reported debt levels  (IASB, 2016 a). As a result, some investors may \nperceive the increase  in reported  debt as signifying  higher firm-level risk and demand a higher \nreturn on their investment, which could increase the co st of capital for th ese firms. On the other \nhand, as detailed above the benefits of AASB 16 extend to  greater transparency and financial \nstatement comparability, which can enhance clarity about a firm’s creditworthiness and \npotentially reduce its perceived risk. In turn, this could reduce the cost of capital for those firms. \nOverall, it is difficult  to establish , ex-ante, the impact of AASB 16 on the cost of capital for \nfirms, with the  effect likely to vary according to  a firm’s unique circumstances.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 15}
page_content='17 \n In our empirical analysis, we aim to investigate the impact of the introduction of AASB  \n15 and 16 on the cost of capital for an average ASX -listed company , as well as  those ASX -\nlisted companies  most affected by AASB  15 and 16. \n4.3 Empirical findings  \nFirst, to make the number of observations reasonably balanced between pre and post \nAASB 15 and AASB 16 reporting periods , we restrict our analysis to the sample period 2015 -\n2020.15 Given our implied cost of equity capital is estimated us ing stock price in June each \nyear, it is plausible that the implementation of AASB 15 in January 2018 and AASB 16 in \nJanuary 2019 should be well incorporated into June security prices for the estimation of the \ncost of equity capital in 2018 and 2019 , respe ctively . \nFigure 1 presents the average of 𝑟𝐴𝑉𝐸 across our 2015 -2020 sample period. The average \ncost of equity capital is reasonably flat at around 7% in 2015, 2016, and 2017. There appears \nto be a drop in the cost of equity capital to 6.18% in 2018 and  this drop is also apparent in 2019 \nand 2020. Thus, this graph seems to show that there is a decline in the average cost of equity \ncapital in the period after 2017  for Australian firms . \n{INSERT FIGURE 1}  \nFigure 2 shows the results from a regression of 𝑟𝐴𝑉𝐸 on a set of dummy variables that \nindicate the year in the sample period 2015 -2020 and with supressed  intercept. The figure \ndisplays the coefficient estimates  (multiplied by 100) , together with the 95% confidence \nintervals. It is clear that 𝑟𝐴𝑉𝐸 is lower from 2018 onwards. Overall, Figures 1 and 2 show that \n𝑟𝐴𝑉𝐸 drops in the period that follows the adoption of AASB 15  and, subsequently,  AASB 16. \n{INSERT FIGURE 2} \nNext, w e continue  our main empirical analysis by investigating the relationship \nbetween the adoption of AASB 15 and AASB 16 and the implied cost of equity capital in a \nregression framework.

We acknowledge that 2018 is prior to the implementation date of AASB 16. However, due to the difficulty in \ndisentangling the individual effects, if any, of AASB 15 and AASB 16 on the implied cost of equity capital, our' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 16}

Model (3) presents the \nregression on POST _AASB _15/16, controls , and industry  fixed effects.  Model (4) presents the \nregression on POST _AASB _15/16, controls, and industry and year fixed effects.   \n{INSERT TABLE 3} \nIn model ( 1), the coefficient on POST _AASB _15/16 is negative and statistically \nsignificant at the 1 percent level. This negative and significant coefficient is consistent with the \nnotion that , collectively,  AASB 15 and AASB 16 improve financial transparency for firms , on \naverage , and that investors perceive th e adoption of both standards as of lower risk and , hence , \ndemanding a lower cost of equity capital. More specifically, the coefficient estimates suggest \nthat in the period after the adoption of AASB 15 and AASB 16, the average implied cost of \nequity capital drops by 103 basis points. As expected, the results in model (2) show that the \ninclusion of control variables somewhat attenuates the negative relation between AASB 15 and \nAASB 16 adoption  and a firm’s cost of equity.17 Specifically, the coefficient estimate on \nPOST _AASB _15/16 is -0.0094 and also significant at the 1 percent level .18 In model (3), the \ninclusion of industry  fixed effects reduces  the coefficient on POST _AASB _15/16 to -0.0089 . In \nmodel (4) , where we include control variables , industry and year fixed effects, the coefficient \nestimate on POST _AASB _15/16 is 0.0 190 and statistically significant at the 1 percent level. \nWe choose model (4) as the main model for subsequent empirical analyses.  \nGiven  that the sample mean of the implied cost of equity is 8.86%, the 190-basis -point \ndecrease in model (4) of Table 2 translates to a 21.44% (=0.0 190/0.0886) drop in a firm’s cost \n                                                           \nfocus is on the cost of equity effects of accounting standard setting, which incorporates the collective effects of \nAASB 15 and AASB 16. As additional analysis, we reclassify POST _AASB _15/16  to take a value of 1 for \nobservations from 2019 onwards, and 0 otherwis e. Our results are robust to this alternative specification. We \ncannot, however, attribute these findings solely to AASB 16 adoption, as there may be lingering cost of equity \neffects associated with AASB 15 adoption.        \n17 We also rerun the regressions in Table 3 using the implied cost of equity calculated by taking the median of the \nfour individual estimates  or using the implied cost of equity in excess of the risk -free rate  and the results are \nquantitatively and qualitati vely similar.   \n18 Harvey (2017) suggests that researchers should take prior information into account by specifying a prior on all \ntestable hypotheses and employ a Symmetric and Descending Minimum Bayes Factor (SD -MBF) approach. This \nis to assess the p-value  of an effect in a Bayesian framework instead of inferring research conclusions from the \nnormal reported p-value. Following Harvey (2017), on a prior probability of 20% that there might be an effect of \nAASB  15 and 16 adoption  on the average implied cost of  equity capital and the reported p-value of 0.001 for the \ncoefficient of POST _AASB_ 15/16 in model (4), we can compute the SD -MBF for the adoption  effect of 0.0188 \nwith a Bayesiani sed p-value of 0.0699. Thus, there is a 7% chance the null hypothesis (no effect from  POST  AASB \n15/16 on the cost of equity capital given a prior of 20% probability) is true.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 17}

In this regression, we include the intercept which represents the \naverage rAVE in 2015.  Thus, the coefficient on each dummy variable can be interpreted as the \ndifference between the average rAVE in a particular year relative to the average rAVE  in 2015. It \nis evident that relative to the average  rAVE in 2015, there are significant drops in the average \nimplied cost of equity capital in 2018 and 20 20.20  \n{INSERT FIGURE 3}  \n4.4 Multivariate analysis of individual cost of equity capital  \nWe next report , in Table 4, the regression output from model (4) of Table 3 for each of \nthe four measures of the implied cost of equity capital. Consistent with the results reported in \nTable 3, the coefficient o n POST_ AASB _15/16 is negative and statistically significant at the 1 \npercent level (with t-statistics of -5.65) in the regression using the implied cost of equity capital \nfrom the Gode and Mohanram  (2003) method  (model  1).

For example, e ntities \nwithin the telecommunication s industry  regularly bundle the sale of telecommunication \nservices and equipment, such as ha ndsets . These handsets tend to either be fre e or heavily \ndiscounted as an incentive to enter long -term telecommunication service contracts (PwC, \n2016). Previously, any revenue allocated to the handset was often limited to the amount, if any, \nthe customer paid for the handset, with the bulk of  revenu e from the contract recognised \nproportionately over the term of the service contract. Under AASB 15, however, the revenue \nfrom a contract is to be allocated to each distinct good or service provided on a relative \nstandalone selling price basis, with revenu e recognised when the performance obligation \nattached to the distinct good or service has been satisfied (Deloitte, 2014). The revenue \nrecognition model of AASB 15 has , therefore,  led to significant changes in revenue and profit \nrecognition of entities within the telecommunications industry , as well as the need for entities \nto change their internal controls, processes systems including those pertaining to data collection \nto comply with AASB 15 reporting requirements  (Davern et al., 2018; BDO Australia, 2021) . \nSimilar s ignificant impact has also been experienced by those entities within the software \ndevelopment and real estate industries.21  \nRegarding  AASB 16, entities within the airline and retail  industries are most  affected \nby its introduction. In support , the IASB identified that for a global sample of lessee companies, \n                                                           \n21 For a more detailed discussion of the impact of AASB 15 on the telecommunications, software development \nand real estate industries, refer to PwC (2017 ), PwC (2019) and BDO Australia (2015), respe ctively.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 19}
page_content='21 \n the balance sheet of those within these two industries would be most impacted by the \nintroduction of IFRS 16 (IASB, 2016 a). Previously, lessees within both industries tended to \naccount for their high -value, long -term leases (of aircraft for airlines  and retail stores or \nwarehouses for retailers) off balance sheet  (IASB, 2016 a). The recognition of right -of-use \nassets and corresponding lease liabilities on balance sheet for almost all leases, per AASB 16, \nsignificantly impacted the financial position of airlines and retailers, with a global lease \ncapitalisation study by PwC estimating that there would be a median increase in debt of 98% \nfor retailers and 47% for airlines (PwC, 2018). Such significant increases in reported debt levels \npotentially lead to investor perceptions of heightened firm risk, including their lack of \ncreditworthine ss, and ultimately higher cost of capital.   \n4.5.2 Discussion of AASB 15 and 16 in earnings conference calls  \nAnother  way to derive a firm ’s exposure to AASB 15 and 16 is to analy se the extent of \ndiscussion of either accounting  standard during earnings conference calls. Earnings conference \ncalls provide an opportunity for firms to communicate with investors and analysts about their \nfinancial performance, as well as the impact of new accounting standards such as AASB 15 \nand 16. \nBy analysing  transcripts of these calls, researchers can identify the frequency and extent \nof discussion of AASB 15 and 16 by the firm ’s management team. Firms that extensively \ndiscuss AASB 15 and 16 during their conference calls suggest s that the respectiv e standard has \na significant impact on them  and may signal heightened  exposure to the adoption of either or \nboth standard s. Firms that do not discuss either standard during earnings conference calls \nsuggests they are unaffected, or minimally impacted, by either or both standards.  \nFurthermore, the tone and sentiment of the discussion can also provide insights into the \nfirm’s perception of the impact of AASB 15 and 16. If the management team expresses \nconcerns and challenges (or a positive attitude) related to the implementation of the se \nstandard s, it may suggest a negative (positive) exposure to AASB 15 and AASB 16 \nimplementation . Overall, analysing  the extent of discussion and tone of discussion of AASB \n15 and AASB 16 during earnings conference calls can be  a useful approach to derive a firm ’s \nexposure to the se standards  and assess its potential impact on firms . \nWe begin by collecting revenue recognition and lease  related text according to the \nlanguage used in AASB 15 and 16. Such  text, which has a high likelihood of referring to  \nrevenue recognition or lease-related topics because of the ir presence in AASB 15 or AASB 16 ,' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 20}

To enlarge the library of non-revenue recognition and non-lease \nrelated text, we al so include the language from the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American \nEnglish (Du Bois et al., 2000). From these two libraries , we identify a list of bigrams \n(combinations of two adjacent words) that are exclusively used in revenue recognition and \nlease -related t ext. \nWe next decompose each conference call transcript for our firms in 2018 and 2019 into \na list of bigrams.23 We then develop an algorithm that parses each bigram and counts the \nnumber of times that bigrams from our revenue recognition and lease  library appear. In \nconducting sentiment analysis of each target  bigram, we use the FinBERT model trained by \nHuang et al. (2022) to evaluate the sentiment of sentences matched to the sentence containing \nthe bigram.24 Finally, we scale the total count by the  total number of positive sentiment bigrams \nminus the total number of negative sentiment bigrams in the conference call transcript.  \nAppendix B provides a description of this algorithm.  \n We next report , in Table 5, the regression output from the analysis of  industry \nmembership and conference call discussion. In model (1), IND is an indicator dummy that takes \na value of 1 for firms operating in those industries that are likely more affected by AASB 15 \nor 16, and 0 otherwise.25 In model (2), DIS(+)  takes a value of 1 for firms with positive \ndiscussion of AASB 15 and 16, and 0 otherwise. In model (3), DIS( -) takes a value of 1 for \nfirms with negative discussion of AASB 15 and 16, and 0 otherwise.26 \nIn model (1), the coefficient estimate on POST _AASB _15/16×IND  is -0.0029 but \nstatistically insignificant. Thus, we do not find evidence that the effect of AASB 15 and 16 \n                                                           \n22 For example, bigrams of ‘standard’ language in AASB 16 include ‘lessee under’, ‘with lease’, or  ‘lease terms’ .  \n23 We employ transcripts of conference calls for Australian firms from Refinitiv Eikon StreetEvents. Each \nconference call often begins with a management presentation about current and future firm performance, which \nis followed by a question -and-answer (Q&A) session that includes the participation of financial analysts an d other \nparties. To measure revenue recognition and lease -related discussion , we use the entire textual data of each \nconference call transcript.  \n24 This method avoids the truncation of sentences and most importantly considers the context of text. This way, \nwe are able to determine whether a revenue recognition or lease bigram is associated with positive or negative \nsentiment.  \n25 These are the telecommunications, software development, airline, retail, and real estate industr ies. \n26 DIS(+) and DIS( -) are not strictly opposite of each other as there are call transcripts where we do not  detect any \ndiscussion relating to AASB  15 or AASB  16, or where the discussion is neutral.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 21}

In model (2), the coefficient estima te on POST _AASB _15/16×DIS(+) is -0.0102 and \nstatistically significant at the 10 percent level. Thus, there is evidence that when firm \nmanagement and analysts discuss AASB 15 or 16 adoption in a positive sentiment, the overall \nreduction in the cost of equity capital is much more pronounced. In model (3), the coefficient \nestimate on POST _AASB _15/16×DIS( -) is 0.00 11 and statistically insignificant. Thus, there is \nno evidence that when firm management and analysts discuss AASB 15 or 16 adoption in a \nnegative sentiment, there is any differential impact on cost of equity.  \n{INSERT TABLE 5} \nOverall, the results in Table 5 suggest that there is some evidence that when firms and \nstakeholders , such as analysts,  view AASB 15 and 16 positively, there is higher  reducing  \nimpact of AASB 15 and 16 on cost of equity capital.  There is, however, no differential impact \nbased on industry membership. Our findings generally support prior findings on the negative \nrelation between the disclosure of IFRS and t he cost of capital in Australia documented in Saha \nand Bose  (2020)  and Persakis and Iatridis (2017) . \n4.6 Caveats  regarding the  impact of AASB 15 and 16 adoption on cost of equity capital  \nThe adoption of AASB 15 and 16 may have a n impact on a company’s cost of equity \ncapital , as discussed in the previous section s. However, the evidence supporting this claim \nshould be interpreted with caution, due to the following caveats.  \n4.6.1 Small sample of firms covered  \nThere is a limited amount of data available on the impact of AASB 15 and 16 on the \ncost of equity capital. This is because the se standard s were  only recently adopted by Australian \ncompanies, and the data to construct the implied cost of equity capital only  cover a certain \npercentage of ASX -listed firms  (mostly tilted towards large market capitali sation firms) . Our \nsample does not cover smaller public firms or any private firms. Therefore, the research  that \nhas been conducted may have a small sample size, which can limit the generali sability of the \nfindings.  \n4.6.2 Possible estimation error  \nTo estimate the impact of AASB 15 and 16 on the cost of equity capital, we use \naccounting model s that reverse -engineer the implied cost of equity capital. Th ese model s are' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 22}
page_content='24 \n based on a number of assumptions  as discussed above in the methodology section , and there is \na risk of estimation error.  For example , the assumption of an efficient stock price at the time of \nour cost of equity estimation can lead to inaccurate results  if the market is, in fact, not \nefficient .27 \n4.6.3 Possible confounding effects  \nThe adoption of AASB 15 and AASB 16 may be accompanied by other changes that \ncould affect the cost of equity capital, such as changes in corporate governance practices or \nchanges in management strategy. These confounding effects can make it difficult to isolate the \nimpact of AASB 15 and 16 on the cost of equity capital. As a result, it is important to control \nfor these confounding effects when analysing  the impact of AASB 15 and 16.28 However, given \nthe annual frequency of the calculation of the implied cost of equity, it is inherently diff icult to \nfully control for all confounding factors that may happen over the course of a year.  \nIn summary, while evidence in our research suggests that the adoption of AASB 15 and \n16 may have a negative impact on a company ’s cost of equity capital, the results should be \ninterpreted with caution due to the small sample of firms covered, possible estimation error, \nand possible confounding effects. The AASB  should be aware of these limitations when \nassessing  the impact of AASB 15 and 16, or the adoption of other Australian accounting \nstandards , on the cost of equity capital.  \n5. Alternative proxies of the cost of capital  \nIn this section, we examine a  range of a lternative  ways to estimate the cost of capital, each of \nwhich provide  different perspectives on the expected returns of an investment . These \nalternative proxies may be used by policy makers and researchers as substitutes, or \n                                                           \n27 To address this point, we have employed stock price at the end of March each year inst ead of at the end of June \nin the calibration of the implied cost of equity capital and repeat our main analysis. The results are qualitatively \nsimilar to those presented in this report.  \n28 In addition to firm -specific confounding effects, such as changes in  corporate governance practices or changes \nin management strategy, there are also potential macro -level confounding effects, including the following: \nEconomic conditions : The Australian economy may have experienced significant changes after 2018, which cou ld \nhave affected the cost of capital for companies.  Regulatory changes : Apart from the adoption of AASB  15 and \n16, there may have been other regulatory changes in Australia after 2018, which could have influenced the cost \nof capital.  Industry -specific even ts: Different industries in Australia may have experienced unique events after \n2018 that could have affected the cost of capital.  Global events : Global events such as geopolitical tensions, natural \ndisasters, or pandemics can have significant impacts on th e economy and financial markets, making it challenging \nto isolate the effect of AASB  15 and 16 adoption on the cost of capital.  While studying the impact of AASB  15 \nand 16 adoption on the cost of capital in Australia, it is crucial to consider the potentia l confounding events that \nmay have occurred after 2018.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 23}
page_content='25 \n complements, to the more traditional estimates previously discussed when examining the \nassociation b etween cost of capital and accounting standard setting .   \n5.1 Bond yield  \nBond yield refers to the rate of return that investors receive from investing in bonds \nissued by a company. The yield on a bond is determined by a variety of factors, including the \ncreditworthiness of the company, the term of the bond, and prevailing market interest rates. \nBond yield can be used as a measure of the cost of debt capital, as it reflects the interest rate \nthat a company must pay on its debt obligations. However, it shou ld be noted that the cost of \ndebt capital is typically lower than the cost of equity capital, since bondholders have a lower \nlevel of risk and are paid before equity holders in the event of bankruptcy.  Most importantly, \nthe corporate bond market in Austral ia is considered to be relatively thin compared to other \ndeveloped economies such as the United States and Europe.29 Due to the thinness of the \ncorporate bond market in Australia, bond yield as a cost of capital estimate is available for only \na small number  of Australian entities.  \n5.2 Bank loan spread  \nBank loan spread refer to the difference between the interest rate charged on a loan and \na benchmark interest rate, such as the London Inter -Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or the prime \nrate. Banks typically charge a spread to compensate for the risk of default on a loan, and the \nspread will vary depending on the creditworthiness of the borrower, the term of the loan, and \nother factors. Bank loan spread can be used as a meas ure of the cost of debt capital, as they \nreflect the additional interest that a company must pay on a loan due to its credit risk.  \nBoth bond yield and bank loan spread have their advantages and disadvantages as \nmeasures of the cost of capital. Bond yield i s a widely used and easily accessible measure but \nis not relevant in estimating cost of equity capital given  bondholders have a lower level of risk \nthan equity holders  (Bodie et al., 2017) . Bank loan spread may be a n accurate measure of the \n                                                           \n29 There are several reasons why the corporate bond market in Australia is thin . These are as follows. Dominance \nof the banking sector : The Australian financial system is dominated by banks, which means that companies often \nrely on bank financing rather than issuing bonds. This has limited the development of the corporate bond market \nin Australia.  Size of the economy : Australia is a relatively small economy compared to the United States and \nEurope, which means that there are fewer large companies with the size and scale to issue bonds.  Investor \npreference for other asset classes : Australian investors tend to prefer other asset classes such as equities and \nproperty, which can limit demand for corporat e bonds.  Regulatory environment : The regulatory environment in \nAustralia can make it more difficult for companies to issue bonds, which can limit the number of issuers in the \nmarket.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 24}

This is because it \nmay be difficult to estimate the implied cost of equity capital, bon d yield, or bank loan spread \nfor private firms due to limited access to the capital markets or lack of publicly available \nfinancial information.  \nIn this approach, the cost of debt is calculated as the total interest paid by the company \ndivided by the total  amount of interest -bearing debt that the company has. This calculation \nprovides an estimate of the average interest rate that the company is paying on its debt, which \ncan be considered as the cost of debt for the firm.  \nThis method has been used in previou s studies such as Francis, et el.  (2005), Kim et al.  \n(2011), and Pittman and Fortin (2004). These studies have shown that this measure of cost of \ndebt is a relevant and reliable proxy for the actual cost of debt, especially for private firms \nwhere other me asures of cost of capital may be difficult to estimate.31 \n5.4 Stock liquidity  \nStock liquidity can be considered an alternative measure of the cost of capital. Liquidity \nrefers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without causing a significant change \nin its price. In the context of stocks, liquidity is often measured using metrics such as bid -ask \nspread, trading volume, and market depth.  \nOne way to view liquidity as a measure of the cost of capital is that a more liquid stock \nis more  attractive to investors because it can be easily bought and sold without causing \n                                                           \n30 For example, banking relationship s or the geographical location of firm s can relate to bank loan spreads.  We \nhave also conducted an empirical analysis of bank loan spreads for Australian firms around the implementation  \nof AASB 15 and 16 (untabulated). We do not find evidence of any effect of the implementation  of AASB 15 and \n16 on bank loan spreads.  In addition, there is no effect of the implementation  of AASB 15 and 16 on the size of \nbank loans ( proxied by the dollar amount of loans). Thus, we conclude that the introductio n of AASB 15 and \nAASB 16 has had no effect on the cost  of debt capital.  \n31 The removal of A ustralian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC)  search fees for company information in \nAustralia will make it easier for investors, analysts, and other stakeholders to access data on private firms, \nincluding interest paid and other financial information necessary for calculating the cost of debt. With greater \naccess to this information, researchers can more accurately estimate the cost of debt for private firms, which is \nparticularly important given that the cost of equity is often difficult to estimate for these companies.  Thus, t he \nremoval of ASIC sea rch fees is a welcome development for anyone interested in better understanding the cost of \ncapital for private Australian firms.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 25}

This makes it easier and cheaper for the firm to raise capital by \nissuing new equity, as investors will be more willing to purchase shares knowin g that they can \neasily sell them in the future  (Amihud and Mendelson, 1986) . On the other hand, a less liquid \nstock may be viewed as having a higher cost of capital, as investors may require a higher return \nto compensate for the additional risk associated with holding a less liquid asset. In this sense, \nfirms with less liquid stocks may find it more difficult and expensive to raise capital through \nequity issuances.  \nOverall, while liquidity is not a direct measure of the cost of capital, it can provide \nimpor tant insights into the willingness of investors to hold a stock, which can in turn impact \nthe firm ’s ability to raise capital and the associated costs.  \n5.5 Seasoned equity offering  discount  \nSeasoned equity offering (SEO) discount is the percentage difference between the offer \nprice of new equity shares issued in an SEO and the market price of existing shares before the \noffering , and may be  used as a measure of the cost of equity for firms that issue new shares of \nequity.  The intuition behind using SEO discount as a measure of the cost of equity is that \ninvestors require a higher return on their investment in new equity shares compared to their \ninvestment in existing equity shares because of the dilution effect of the new equity shares. \nThus, the higher the SEO discount, the higher the cost of equity for the firm.   \nHowever, using SEO discount as a measure of the cost of equity has some limitations. \nFirst, the SEO discount reflects only the market perception of the cost of eq uity at a particular \npoint in time and may not reflect the true cost of equity for the firm over the long run. Second, \nthe SEO discount may be influenced by factors other than the cost of equity, such as market \nconditions, investor sentiment, and the chara cteristics of the SEO itself. Finally, SEOs are \nrelatively rare events for most firms, and therefore, using SEO discount as a measure of the \ncost of equity may not be applicable for all firms.  \nOverall, while SEO discount can be used as an alternative measu re of the cost of equity, \nit should be used with caution and in conjunction with other measures of the cost of capital to \nobtain a more accurate estimate of a firm's true cost of capital.  \n5.6 Financial analyst forecast accuracy and disagreement  \nAnalyst for ecast accuracy and disagreement are commonly used outcome variables to \nstudy the decision -usefulness of information provided in accordance with  accounting standards" metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 26}
page_content="28 \n (see, for example, Asbaugh and Pincus, 2001) . Analysts are financial experts who provide \nforecasts of a company's future earnings and financial performance.  Forecast accuracy is \ntypically measured by comparing the analyst’s forecasted earnings to the actual earnings \nreported by the company. If the analyst’s forecast is close to actual earnings , this suggests that \nthe analyst has a good understanding of the company's financial performance and that \naccounting standards have been effective in providing relevant and faithfully representative \ninformation to the market. On the other hand, if the fore cast is significantly different from \nactual earnings, this could indicate that accounting standards have not been effective in \nproviding the market with relevant and faithfully representative information.  \nForecast disagreement, on the other hand, measures  the extent to which different \nanalysts have divergent views on a company’s future earnings or cash flows. If there is a high \nlevel of forecast disagreement, this suggests that accounting standards have not been effective \nin providing comparable and unders tandable information to the market. A low level of forecast \ndisagreement suggests the alternative.  \nBy comparing forecast accuracy and disagreement before and after the adoption of a \nnew accounting standard, researchers can evaluate whether the new standard  has improved the \ndecision -usefulness of information provided by financial statement preparers . Additionally, by \nstudying differences in forecast accuracy and disagreement across different countries and \nindustries, researchers can identify the factors that  influence the effectiveness of accounting \nstandards in different contexts.  \n6. Recommendations  and conclusions  \nThe cost of capital is an important concept in accounting and finance that plays a crucial \nrole in decision -making , including that of investors . A statutory function  of the AASB is to \nmake or formulate accounting standards  that reduce the cost of capital . To obtain greater clarity \non the  outcomes of its standard -setting process , and whether it  is fulfilling its statutory \nfunctions,  the AASB is seeking input on potential models for determining the cost of capital.  \nThis report examines the various models  that estimate  cost of capital and applies a subset of \nthese estimates to investigate the association between cost of capital and acc ounting standard -\nsetting in Australia.  \nIn our review  of the various estimation models , we recommend that for ASX -listed \ncompanies  the AASB consider using the implied cost of equity capital to assess the association \nbetween cost of capital and accounting standard -setting in Australia . The implied cost of equity" metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 27}
page_content='29 \n capital is derived from market prices and provides an estimate of the expected return required \nby investors for investing in a particular company ’s equity. This cost of equity measure reflects \ninves tors’ expectations and perceptions of the company ’s future performance and risk and , by \ndoing so,  overcomes the shortcomings of other cost of capital models such as the CAPM, which \nrelies on historical data as inputs to estimate a forward -looking measure . Using the implied \ncost of equity capital can also help the AASB to anticipate potential market reactions to the \nadoption of a new accounting standard, thereby enabling the AASB  to make informed decisions \nabout the implementation of specific accounting standa rds.  \nWe do, however, acknowledge the limitations of estimating implied cost of equity \ncapital , including potential estimation error and it s estimation  being confined  to a small subset \nof preparers.  Given Australian accounting standards a re applicable to a broad set of entities, \nincluding public and private for -profit  and not-for-profit  entities , we outline  alternative proxies \nof the cost of capital that are applicable to a broader set of preparers. We recommend the AASB \nconsider using the se proxies to either complement , or as an alternative to,  implied cost of equity \ncapital estimates  in the appropriate context. By utilisi ng the implied cost of equity alongside \nother measures or qualitative assessments , the AASB can help demonstrate that its standard -\nsetting facilitates  fulfillment of its statutory functions  for the benefit of a broad set of \nstakeholders .' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 28}

(2012), \nDahliwal et al. \n(2016)  \n \nHou et al. (2012) show that analysts’ forecasts exhibit critical biases  that can, in turn, affect the \nfinal implied cost of equity capital estimate.  Moreover, relying on analysts’ forecasts \nconstrains the cross -section to the sparse coverage of analysts (La Porta, 1996; Hong et al., \n2000; Diether et al., 2002). Therefore, we follow Hou et al. and for each year between 1995 \nand 20 21, we estimate the following pooled cross -sectional regression using the past ten years \nof data:  \n𝐸𝑗,𝑡+𝜏=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑇𝐴𝑗,𝑡+𝛽2𝐷𝐼𝑉 𝑗,𝑡+𝛽3𝐷𝐷 𝑗,𝑡+𝛽4𝐸𝑗,𝑡 \n+𝛽5𝑁𝑒𝑔𝐸 𝑗,𝑡+ 𝛽6𝐴𝑐𝑐 𝑗,𝑡+𝜖𝑗,𝑡 ,    (A.1)' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 30}

All \nexplanatory variables are measured at the end of year t: 𝑇𝐴𝑗,𝑡 is the total assets; 𝐷𝐼𝑉 𝑗,𝑡 is the \ndividend payment; 𝐷𝐷 𝑗,𝑡 is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1  for dividend payers or 0 \notherwise; 𝑁𝑒𝑔𝐸 𝑗,𝑡 is a dummy variable that equals 1 for firms with negative earnings or 0 \notherwise; and 𝐴𝑐𝑐 𝑗,𝑡 is total accruals. 32 Similar to Hou et al.  (2012) , we focus on the dollar \nearnings to make the model’s forecasts comparable with analysts’ forecasts. To mitigate the \npotential impact of outliers, we also winsorize the explanatory variables at the 1st and 99th \npercentiles.  \nFor each firm j and year t, earnings forecasts from year t+1 to year t+5 into the fut ure are \nestimated by multiplying the explanatory variables as of year t with the estimated coefficients \nfrom (B.1). As the estimation is conducted in current year t, survivorship bias is avoided. \nHaving estimated earnings forecasts, we derive each of the f our individual implied cost of \nequity capital  estimates for each firm at the end of June each year t by computing the internal \nrate of return such that the market equity at the end of June is equal to the present value of \nfuture earnings.  \n  \n  \n                                                           \n32 Following Hribar and Collins (2002) , accruals measure is computed using the c ash flow statement method as \nthe difference between earnings and cash flows from operations.' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/AASB Report DRAFT _24APRIL23.pdf', 'page': 31}
page_content='33 \n APPENDIX B  \nOur objective is straightforward: to measure the proportion of each quarterly conference call \nin which participants discuss revenue recognition and lease accounting topics in accordance \nwith AASB 15 and 16. Prior studies have identified topics of interest by relying on pre -\nspecified lists of signal language. For example, Hassan et al. (2019) use political text to \nconsider the language that could be associated with political topics and Hassan et al. (2021a, \nb) study COVID -19 and Brexit by using individual wo rds that exclusively relate to these \nshocks. Sautner et al. (2021) study firm -level climate exposure by identifying language that \ncarries climate content. Li and Truong (2023) study firm -level auditing and accounting risk by \nidentifying the language the PC AOB uses in official documents of auditing standards. To this \nend, we need to differentiate between the language that relates to revenue recognition and lease \naccounting topics in accordance with AASB 15 and 16 and the language that relates to non-\nrevenue recognition and non-lease accounting topics.  \nWe employ a pattern -based classification approach from computational linguistics to \nidentify whether the language that is used by participants relates to revenue recognition and \nlease accounting topics in accord ance with AASB 15 and 16. The standard approach to text \ncategori sation has been to use a document representation in a word -based space where a \nsimple -minded independent word -based representation, also known as a bag-of-words (BOW), \ncan be very effective. H owever, Bekkerman and Allan (2004) suggest that the use of bigrams \ninstead of single words can be particularly useful for text classification in domains where \nlexicons are relatively restrictive and the language can form stable phrases. We, therefore, \napply the use of bigrams in our setup to identify the language that is associated with revenue \nrecognition and lease accounting topics in accordance with AASB 15 and 16 because such \nlanguage is likely to have these features.  \nAlthough the use of bigrams can be more informative than the use of a BOW because \nbigrams capture more context around each word, this comes at a cost because a bag of bigrams \ncan produce a much larger and sparser feature set than a BOW. Thus, a filtering process is \nrequired to help minimi se this cost. For this purpose, we develop a training library of revenue \nrecognition and lease accounting text in accordance with AASB 15 and 16 and another training \nlibrary of non-revenue recognition and non-lease accounting text. These libraries are a \ncollection of bigrams from revenue recognition and lease accounting text in accordance with \nAASB 15 and 16 or from non-revenue recognition and non-lease accounting text. Given that \nthere is some overlap between these two libraries, we derive a final revenue re cognition and \nlease accounting library of bigrams that exclusively appear in the first library.  \nWe first decompose each conference call transcript into a list of bigrams. We then \ndevelop an algorithm that parses each bigram and counts the number of times that bigrams \nfrom our final revenue recognition and lease accounting library appear. Finally, we scale the \ntotal count by the total number of bigrams in the conference call transcript. The following \nformula depicts this construct of revenue recognition and  lease accounting discussion : \nThe following formula depicts this construct of auditing and accounting risk:  \n𝑅𝑒𝑣  𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  & 𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑖,𝑡= ∑ (1[𝑏∈𝐴\\𝑁]×𝑇𝐹𝐼𝐷𝐹𝑏)𝑏𝑖,𝑡,𝑗\n𝑏𝑖,𝑡,1\n𝐵𝑖,𝑡                             (B.1) \nwhere: subscripts i, t, j represent firm, year, and bigram, respectively. bi,t,1, …, bi,t,j is a list of \nfirm i’s bigrams, [ b1, …, bj], in its quarterly earnings conference call t.

It takes a value of one if bigram \nb exists in A\\N, and zero otherwise. 𝑇𝐹_𝐼𝐷𝐹𝑏 is the term frequency –inverse document \nfrequency of bigram b (i.e., the weighting) which is calculated as the product of the term \nfrequency and the inverse document frequency ( TF×IDF ).33 Bi,t is the total nu mber of bigrams \nin firm i’s earnings conference call in year t. Rev Recognition  & LeaseDiscussion i,t is the firm -\nlevel revenue recognition and lease discussion  (or discussion of AASB  15 and 16) for firm i in \nyear t. In conducting sentiment analysis of each target bigram, we use the FinBERT model \ntrained by Huang et al. (2022) to evaluate the sentiment of sentences matched to the sentence \ncontaining the bigram. Finally, we scale the total count by the total number of p ositive \nsentiment bigrams minus the total number of negative sentiment bigrams in the conference call \ntranscript.  \nEquation ( B.1) is an application of a classic text -classification algorithm in which we \naugment the algorithm with the revenue recognition and lease bigram and also use a scalar, \nwhich is equivalent to the length of the call. In this calculation, we employ a weighted count \nof bigrams because certain bigrams may be more relevant to revenue recognition and lease \ntopics than others. In robustness checks, we construct revenue recognition and lease discussion \nin Equation ( B.1) by employing a simple count in which each bigram is given an equal weight, \nthat is, the term frequency –inverse document frequency of a bigram is set to on e.  \n  \n                                                           \n33 TF is the frequency of bigram  b occurring in  A.

page_content='IFRS 15\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn April 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board (Board) adopted\nIAS 11 Construction Contracts  and IAS 18 Revenue , both of which had originally been issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) in December 1993. IAS 18\nreplaced a previous version: Revenue Recognition  (issued in December 1982). IAS 11 replaced\nparts of IAS 11 Accounting for Construction Contracts  (issued in March 1979).\nIn December 2001 the Board issued SIC-31  Revenue—Barter Transactions Involving Advertising\nServices . The Interpretation was originally developed by the Standards Interpretations\nCommittee of the IASC to determine the circumstances in which a seller of advertising\nservices can reliably measure revenue at the fair value of advertising services provided in\na barter transaction.\nIn June 2007 the Board issued IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes . The Interpretation\nwas developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (the ‘Interpretations Committee’)\nto address the accounting by the entity that grants award credits to its customers.\nIn July 2008 the Board issued IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate . The\nInterpretation was developed by the Interpretations Committee to apply to the\naccounting for revenue and associated expenses by entities that undertake the\nconstruction of real estate directly or through subcontractors.\nIn January 2009 the Board issued IFRIC 18  Transfers of Assets from Customers . The\nInterpretation was developed by the Interpretations Committee to apply to the\naccounting for transfers of items of property, plant and equipment by entities that\nreceive such transfers from their customers.\nIn May 2014 the Board issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers , together with\nthe introduction of Topic 606 into the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting\nStandards Codification®. IFRS 15 replaces IAS 11, IAS 18, IFRIC 13, IFRIC 15, IFRIC 18 and\nSIC-31. IFRS 15 provides a comprehensive framework for recognising revenue from\ncontracts with customers.\nIn September 2015 the Board issued Effective Date of IFRS 15  which deferred the mandatory\neffective date of IFRS 15 to 1 January 2018.\nIn April 2016 the Board issued Clarifications  to IFRS 15  Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers clarifying the Board’s intentions when developing some of the requirements\nin IFRS 15. These amendments do not change the underlying principles of IFRS 15 but\nclarify how those principles should be applied and provide additional transitional relief.\nIn May 2017, the Board issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts  which permits an entity to\nchoose whether to apply IFRS 17 or IFRS 15 to specified fixed-fee service contracts that\nmeet the definition of an insurance contract.\nOther Standards have made minor consequential amendments to IFRS 15, including\nIFRS 16 Leases  (issued January 2016) and Amendments to References to the Conceptual\nFramework in IFRS Standards  (issued March 2018).IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A755' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 0}

page_content='International Financial Reporting Standard 15\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nObjective\nThe objective of this Standard is to establish the principles that an entity\nshall apply to report useful information to users of financial  statements\nabout the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue  and cash\nflows  arising from a contract  with a customer .\nMeeting the objective\nTo meet the objective in paragraph 1, the core principle of this Standard is\nthat an entity shall recognise revenue  to depict the transfer of promised goods\nor services to customers  in an amount that reflects the consideration to which\nthe entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nAn entity shall consider the terms of the contract  and all relevant facts and\ncircumstances when applying this Standard. An entity shall apply this\nStandard, including the use of any practical expedients, consistently to\ncontracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.\nThis Standard specifies the accounting for an individual contract  with\na customer . However, as a practical expedient, an entity may apply this\nStandard to a portfolio of contracts (or performance obligations ) with similar\ncharacteristics if the entity reasonably expects that the effects on the financial\nstatements of applying this Standard to the portfolio would not differ\nmaterially from applying this Standard to the individual contracts (or\nperformance obligations) within that portfolio. When accounting for a\nportfolio, an entity shall use estimates and assumptions that reflect the size\nand composition of the portfolio.\nScope\nAn entity shall apply this Standard to all contracts with customers, except the\nfollowing:\n(a) lease contracts within the scope of IFRS 16 Leases ;\n(b) contracts within the scope of IFRS 17  Insurance Contracts .

In some industries and\njurisdictions, a contract modification may be described as a change order, a\nvariation or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties\nto a contract approve a modification that either creates new or changes\nexisting enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. A\ncontract modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement or\nimplied by customary business practices.

In determining whether the\nrights and obligations that are created or changed by a modification are\nenforceable, an entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances\nincluding the terms of the contract and other evidence. If the parties to a\ncontract have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet\ndetermined the corresponding change in price, an entity shall estimate the\nchange to the transaction price arising from the modification in accordance\nwith paragraphs 50 –54 on estimating variable consideration\nand paragraphs 56–58 on constraining estimates of variable consideration.\nAn entity shall account for a contract  modification as a separate contract if\nboth of the following conditions are present:\n(a) the scope of the contract increases because of the addition of promised\ngoods or services that are distinct (in accordance with\nparagraphs 26–30); and\n(b) the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that\nreflects the entity’s stand-alone selling prices  of the additional promised\ngoods or services and any appropriate adjustments to that price to\nreflect the circumstances of the particular contract. For example, an\nentity may adjust the stand-alone selling price of an additional good or\nservice for a discount that the customer receives, because it is not\nnecessary for the entity to incur the selling-related costs that it would\nincur when selling a similar good or service to a new customer.\nIf a contract  modification is not accounted for as a separate contract in\naccordance with paragraph 20, an entity shall account for the promised goods\nor services not yet transferred at the date of the contract modification (ie the\nremaining promised goods or services) in whichever of the following ways is\napplicable:\n(a) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a\ntermination of the existing contract and the creation of a new\ncontract, if the remaining goods or services are distinct from the goods\nor services transferred on or before the date of the contract18\n19\n20\n21IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A763' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 8}

page_content='Promises in contracts with customers\nA contract  with a customer  generally explicitly states the goods or services\nthat an entity promises to transfer to a customer. However, the performance\nobligations  identified in a contract with a customer may not be limited to the\ngoods or services that are explicitly stated in that contract. This is because a\ncontract with a customer may also include promises that are implied by an\nentity’s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements\nif, at the time of entering into the contract, those promises create a valid\nexpectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service to\nthe customer.\nPerformance obligations do not include activities that an entity must\nundertake to fulfil a contract unless those activities transfer a good or service\nto a customer . For example, a services provider may need to perform various\nadministrative tasks to set up a contract. The performance of those tasks does\nnot transfer a service to the customer as the tasks are performed. Therefore,\nthose setup activities are not a performance obligation.\nDistinct goods or services\nDepending on the contract , promised goods or services may include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n(a) sale of goods produced by an entity (for example, inventory of a\nmanufacturer);\n(b) resale of goods purchased by an entity (for example, merchandise of a\nretailer);\n(c) resale of rights to goods or services purchased by an entity (for\nexample, a ticket resold by an entity acting as a principal, as described\nin paragraphs B34–B38);\n(d) performing a contractually agreed-upon task (or tasks) for a customer;\n(e) providing a service of standing ready to provide goods or services (for\nexample, unspecified updates to software that are provided on a when-\nand-if-available basis) or of making goods or services available for a\ncustomer to use as and when the customer decides;\n(f) providing a service of arranging for another party to transfer goods or\nservices to a customer (for example, acting as an agent of another\nparty, as described in paragraphs B34–B38);\n(g) granting rights to goods or services to be provided in the future that a\ncustomer can resell or provide to its customer (for example, an entity\nselling a product to a retailer promises to transfer an additional good\nor service to an individual who purchases the product from the\nretailer);\n(h) constructing, manufacturing or developing an asset on behalf of a\ncustomer;\n(i) granting licences (see paragraphs B52–B63B); and24\n25\n26IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A765' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 10}
page_content='(j) granting options to purchase additional goods or services (when those\noptions provide a customer with a material right, as described in\nparagraphs B39–B43).\nA good or service that is promised to a customer  is distinct if both of the\nfollowing criteria are met:\n(a) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or\ntogether with other resources that are readily available to the\ncustomer (ie the good or service is capable of being distinct); and\n(b) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is\nseparately identifiable from other promises in the contract  (ie the\npromise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of\nthe contract).\nA customer  can benefit from a good or service in accordance with\nparagraph 27(a) if the good or service could be used, consumed, sold for an\namount that is greater than scrap value or otherwise held in a way that\ngenerates economic benefits. For some goods or services, a customer may be\nable to benefit from a good or service on its own. For other goods or services, a\ncustomer may be able to benefit from the good or service only in conjunction\nwith other readily available resources. A readily available resource is a good or\nservice that is sold separately (by the entity or another entity) or a resource\nthat the customer has already obtained from the entity (including goods or\nservices that the entity will have already transferred to the customer under\nthe contract ) or from other transactions or events. Various factors may\nprovide evidence that the customer can benefit from a good or service either\non its own or in conjunction with other readily available resources. For\nexample, the fact that the entity regularly sells a good or service separately\nwould indicate that a customer can benefit from the good or service on its\nown or with other readily available resources.\nIn assessing whether an entity’s promises to transfer goods or services to the\ncustomer  are separately identifiable in accordance with paragraph 27(b), the\nobjective is to determine whether the nature of the promise, within the\ncontext of the contract , is to transfer each of those goods or services\nindividually or, instead, to transfer a combined item or items to which the\npromised goods or services are inputs. Factors that indicate that two or more\npromises to transfer goods or services to a customer are not separately\nidentifiable include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(a) the entity provides a significant service of integrating the goods or\nservices with other goods or services promised in the contract into a\nbundle of goods or services that represent the combined output or\noutputs for which the customer has contracted. In other words, the\nentity is using the goods or services as inputs to produce or deliver the\ncombined output or outputs specified by the customer. A combined\noutput or outputs might include more than one phase, element or\nunit.27\n28\n29IFRS 15\nA766 © IFRS Foundation' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 11}

For\nexample, in some cases, two or more goods or services are significantly\naffected by each other because the entity would not be able to fulfil its\npromise by transferring each of the goods or services independently.\nIf a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity shall combine that good\nor service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of\ngoods or services that is distinct. In some cases, that would result in the entity\naccounting for all the goods or services promised in a contract  as a\nsingle performance obligation.\nSatisfaction of performance obligations\nAn entity shall recognise revenue  when (or as) the entity satisfies  a\nperformance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (ie an\nasset) to a customer . An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer\nobtains control of that asset.\nFor each performance obligation identified in accordance with\nparagraphs 22 –30, an entity shall determine at contract  inception whether it\nsatisfies the performance obligation over time (in accordance with\nparagraphs 35 –37) or satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time\n(in accordance with paragraph 38). If an entity does not satisfy a performance\nobligation over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time.\nGoods and services are assets, even if only momentarily, when they are\nreceived and used (as in the case of many services). Control of an asset refers\nto the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining\nbenefits from, the asset. Control includes the ability to prevent other entities\nfrom directing the use of, and obtaining the benefits from, an asset. The\nbenefits of an asset are the potential cash flows (inflows or savings in\noutflows) that can be obtained directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by:\n(a) using the asset to produce goods or provide services (including public\nservices);\n(b) using the asset to enhance the value of other assets;\n(c) using the asset to settle liabilities or reduce expenses;\n(d) selling or exchanging the asset;\n(e) pledging the asset to secure a loan; and\n(f) holding the asset.\nWhen evaluating whether a customer  obtains control of an asset, an entity\nshall consider any agreement to repurchase the asset (see paragraphs\nB64–B76).30\n31\n32\n33\n34IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A767' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 12}

The assessment of whether an asset has an alternative\nuse to the entity is made at contract  inception. After contract inception, an\nentity shall not update the assessment of the alternative use of an asset unless\nthe parties to the contract approve a contract modification that substantively\nchanges the performance obligation. Paragraphs B6 –B8 provide guidance for\nassessing whether an asset has an alternative use to an entity.\nAn entity shall consider the terms of the contract , as well as any laws that\napply to the contract, when evaluating whether it has an enforceable right to\npayment for performance completed to date in accordance with\nparagraph 35(c) . The right to payment for performance completed to date does\nnot need to be for a fixed amount.

When determining the\ntransaction price, an entity shall consider the effects of all of the following:\n(a) variable consideration (see paragraphs 50–55 and 59);\n(b) constraining estimates of variable consideration (see paragraphs\n56–58);\n(c) the existence of a significant financing component in the contract  (see\nparagraphs 60–65);\n(d) non-cash consideration (see paragraphs 66–69); and\n(e) consideration payable to a customer (see paragraphs 70–72).\nFor the purpose of determining the transaction price, an entity shall assume\nthat the goods or services will be transferred to the customer as promised in\naccordance with the existing contract and that the contract  will not be\ncancelled, renewed or modified.\nVariable consideration\nIf the consideration promised in a contract  includes a variable amount, an\nentity shall estimate the amount of consideration to which the entity will be\nentitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a\ncustomer.\nAn amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, rebates, refunds,\ncredits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties or other\nsimilar items. The promised consideration can also vary if an entity’s\nentitlement to the consideration is contingent on the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of a future event. For example, an amount of consideration would\nbe variable if either a product was sold with a right of return or a fixed\namount is promised as a performance bonus on achievement of a specified\nmilestone.46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A771' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 16}

That is, it is expected that the entity\nwill offer a price concession. Depending on the jurisdiction, industry or\ncustomer this offer may be referred to as a discount, rebate, refund or\ncredit.\n(b) other facts and circumstances indicate that the entity’s intention,\nwhen entering into the contract with the customer, is to offer a price\nconcession to the customer.\nAn entity shall estimate an amount of variable consideration by using either\nof the following methods, depending on which method the entity expects to\nbetter predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled:\n(a) The expected value—the expected value is the sum of probability-\nweighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. An\nexpected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of\nvariable consideration if an entity has a large number of contracts with\nsimilar characteristics.\n(b) The most likely amount—the most likely amount is the single most\nlikely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (ie the\nsingle most likely outcome of the contract). The most likely amount\nmay be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable\nconsideration if the contract has only two possible outcomes (for\nexample, an entity either achieves a performance bonus or does not).\nAn entity shall apply one method consistently throughout the contract  when\nestimating the effect of an uncertainty on an amount of variable consideration\nto which the entity will be entitled. In addition, an entity shall consider all the\ninformation (historical, current and forecast) that is reasonably available to\nthe entity and shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration\namounts. The information that an entity uses to estimate the amount of\nvariable consideration would typically be similar to the information that the\nentity’s management uses during the bid-and-proposal process and in\nestablishing prices for promised goods or services.\nRefund liabilities\nAn entity shall recognise a refund liability if the entity receives consideration\nfrom a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the\ncustomer.

That rate would\nreflect the credit characteristics of the party receiving financing in the\ncontract, as well as any collateral or security provided by the customer or the\nentity, including assets transferred in the contract. An entity may be able to\ndetermine that rate by identifying the rate that discounts the nominal\namount of the promised consideration to the price that the customer would\npay in cash for the goods or services when (or as) they transfer to the\ncustomer. After contract inception, an entity shall not update the discount\nrate for changes in interest rates or other circumstances (such as a change in\nthe assessment of the customer’s credit risk).\nAn entity shall present the effects of financing (interest revenue or interest\nexpense) separately from revenue  from contracts with customers in the\nstatement of comprehensive income.

An\nentity shall account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of\nthe transaction price and, therefore, of revenue unless the payment to the\ncustomer is in exchange for a distinct good or service (as described in\nparagraphs 26 –30) that the customer transfers to the entity.

If the amount of consideration payable to the customer exceeds the\nfair value of the distinct good or service that the entity receives from the\ncustomer, then the entity shall account for such an excess as a reduction of\nthe transaction price. If the entity cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of\nthe good or service received from the customer, it shall account for all of the\nconsideration payable to the customer as a reduction of the transaction price.\nAccordingly, if consideration payable to a customer  is accounted for as a\nreduction of the transaction price, an entity shall recognise the reduction of\nrevenue when (or as) the later of either of the following events occurs:\n(a) the entity recognises revenue for the transfer of the related goods or\nservices to the customer; and\n(b) the entity pays or promises to pay the consideration (even if the\npayment is conditional on a future event).

The best evidence of a\nstand-alone selling price is the observable price of a good or service when the\nentity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to\nsimilar customers. A contractually stated price or a list price for a good or\nservice may be (but shall not be presumed to be) the stand-alone selling price\nof that good or service.\nIf a stand-alone selling price  is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate\nthe stand-alone selling price at an amount that would result in the allocation\nof the transaction price meeting the allocation objective in paragraph 73 .\nWhen estimating a stand-alone selling price, an entity shall consider all\ninformation (including market conditions, entity-specific factors and\ninformation about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably\navailable to the entity. In doing so, an entity shall maximise the use of\nobservable inputs and apply estimation methods consistently in similar\ncircumstances.\nSuitable methods for estimating the stand-alone selling price of a good or\nservice include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(a) Adjusted market assessment approach—an entity could evaluate the\nmarket in which it sells goods or services and estimate the price that a\ncustomer in that market would be willing to pay for those goods or\nservices. That approach might also include referring to prices from the\nentity’s competitors for similar goods or services and adjusting those\nprices as necessary to reflect the entity’s costs and margins.\n(b) Expected cost plus a margin approach—an entity could forecast its\nexpected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an\nappropriate margin for that good or service.\n(c) Residual approach—an entity may estimate the stand-alone selling\nprice by reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the\nobservable stand-alone selling prices of other goods or services\npromised in the contract. However, an entity may use a residual\napproach to estimate, in accordance with paragraph 78, the stand-\nalone selling price of a good or service only if one of the following\ncriteria is met:75\n76\n77\n78\n79IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A777' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 22}

A contract liability is an entity’s obligation to transfer\ngoods or services to a customer for which the entity has received\nconsideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer.\nIf an entity performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before\nthe customer pays consideration or before payment is due, the entity shall\npresent the contract as a contract asset , excluding any amounts presented as a\nreceivable.

Examples include routine or recurring services (such\nas a cleaning service) in which the receipt and simultaneous consumption by\nthe customer of the benefits of the entity’s performance can be readily\nidentified.\nFor other types of performance obligations, an entity may not be able to\nreadily identify whether a customer  simultaneously receives and consumes\nthe benefits from the entity’s performance as the entity performs. In those\ncircumstances, a performance obligation is satisfied over time if an entity\ndetermines that another entity would not need to substantially re -perform the\nwork that the entity has completed to date if that other entity were to fulfil\nthe remaining performance obligation to the customer. In determining\nwhether another entity would not need to substantially re -perform the work\nthe entity has completed to date, an entity shall make both of the following\nassumptions:\n(a) disregard potential contractual restrictions or practical limitations that\notherwise would prevent the entity from transferring the remaining\nperformance obligation to another entity; and\n(b) presume that another entity fulfilling the remainder of the\nperformance obligation would not have the benefit of any asset that is\npresently controlled by the entity and that would remain controlled by\nthe entity if the performance obligation were to transfer to another\nentity.\nCustomer controls the asset as it is created or enhanced\n(paragraph 35(b))\nIn determining whether a customer  controls an asset as it is created or\nenhanced in accordance with paragraph 35(b), an entity shall apply the\nrequirements for control in paragraphs 31 –34 and 38.

page_content='A contractual restriction on an entity’s ability to direct an asset for another\nuse must be substantive for the asset not to have an alternative use to the\nentity. A contractual restriction is substantive if a customer  could enforce its\nrights to the promised asset if the entity sought to direct the asset for another\nuse. In contrast, a contractual restriction is not substantive if, for example, an\nasset is largely interchangeable with other assets that the entity could transfer\nto another customer without breaching the contract  and without incurring\nsignificant costs that otherwise would not have been incurred in relation to\nthat contract.\nA practical limitation on an entity’s ability to direct an asset for another use\nexists if an entity would incur significant economic losses to direct the asset\nfor another use. A significant economic loss could arise because the entity\neither would incur significant costs to rework the asset or would only be able\nto sell the asset at a significant loss.

An amount\nthat would compensate an entity for performance completed to date would be\nan amount that approximates the selling price of the goods or services\ntransferred to date (for example, recovery of the costs incurred by an entity in\nsatisfying the performance obligation plus a reasonable profit margin) rather\nthan compensation for only the entity’s potential loss of profit if the contract\nwere to be terminated. Compensation for a reasonable profit margin need not\nequal the profit margin expected if the contract was fulfilled as promised, but\nan entity should be entitled to compensation for either of the following\namounts:\n(a) a proportion of the expected profit margin in the contract that\nreasonably reflects the extent of the entity’s performance under the\ncontract before termination by the customer (or another party); or\n(b) a reasonable return on the entity’s cost of capital for similar contracts\n(or the entity’s typical operating margin for similar contracts) if the\ncontract-specific margin is higher than the return the entity usually\ngenerates from similar contracts.\nAn entity’s right to payment for performance completed to date need not be a\npresent unconditional right to payment.

page_content='terminated before completion for reasons other than the entity’s failure to\nperform as promised.\nIn some contracts, a customer may have a right to terminate the contract only\nat specified times during the life of the contract or the customer might not\nhave any right to terminate the contract. If a customer acts to terminate a\ncontract without having the right to terminate the contract at that time\n(including when a customer fails to perform its obligations as promised), the\ncontract (or other laws) might entitle the entity to continue to transfer to the\ncustomer the goods or services promised in the contract and require the\ncustomer to pay the consideration promised in exchange for those goods or\nservices. In those circumstances, an entity has a right to payment for\nperformance completed to date because the entity has a right to continue to\nperform its obligations in accordance with the contract and to require the\ncustomer to perform its obligations (which include paying the promised\nconsideration).\nIn assessing the existence and enforceability of a right to payment for\nperformance completed to date, an entity shall consider the contractual terms\nas well as any legislation or legal precedent that could supplement or override\nthose contractual terms. This would include an assessment of whether:\n(a) legislation, administrative practice or legal precedent confers upon the\nentity a right to payment for performance to date even though that\nright is not specified in the contract with the customer;\n(b) relevant legal precedent indicates that similar rights to payment for\nperformance completed to date in similar contracts have no binding\nlegal effect; or\n(c) an entity’s customary business practices of choosing not to enforce a\nright to payment has resulted in the right being rendered\nunenforceable in that legal environment. However, notwithstanding\nthat an entity may choose to waive its right to payment in similar\ncontracts, an entity would continue to have a right to payment to date\nif, in the contract with the customer, its right to payment for\nperformance to date remains enforceable.\nThe payment schedule specified in a contract  does not necessarily indicate\nwhether an entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance\ncompleted to date. Although the payment schedule in a contract specifies the\ntiming and amount of consideration that is payable by a customer , the\npayment schedule might not necessarily provide evidence of the entity’s right\nto payment for performance completed to date.

page_content='Methods for measuring progress towards complete\nsatisfaction of a performance obligation\nMethods that can be used to measure an entity’s progress towards complete\nsatisfaction of a performance obligation satisfied over time in accordance with\nparagraphs 35–37 include the following:\n(a) output methods (see paragraphs B15–B17); and\n(b) input methods (see paragraphs B18–B19).\nOutput methods\nOutput methods recognise revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the\nvalue to the customer  of the goods or services transferred to date relative to\nthe remaining goods or services promised under the contract. Output methods\ninclude methods such as surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals\nof results achieved, milestones reached, time elapsed and units produced or\nunits delivered. When an entity evaluates whether to apply an output method\nto measure its progress, the entity shall consider whether the output selected\nwould faithfully depict the entity’s performance towards complete satisfaction\nof the performance obligation . An output method would not provide a faithful\ndepiction of the entity’s performance if the output selected would fail to\nmeasure some of the goods or services for which control has transferred to the\ncustomer. For example, output methods based on units produced or units\ndelivered would not faithfully depict an entity’s performance in satisfying a\nperformance obligation if, at the end of the reporting period, the entity’s\nperformance has produced work in progress or finished goods controlled by\nthe customer that are not included in the measurement of the output.\nAs a practical expedient, if an entity has a right to consideration from a\ncustomer  in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the\ncustomer of the entity’s performance completed to date (for example, a service\ncontract  in which an entity bills a fixed amount for each hour of service\nprovided), the entity may recognise revenue in the amount to which the entity\nhas a right to invoice.\nThe disadvantages of output methods are that the outputs used to measure\nprogress may not be directly observable and the information required to apply\nthem may not be available to an entity without undue cost. Therefore, an\ninput method may be necessary.\nInput methods\nInput methods recognise revenue  on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs\nto the satisfaction of a performance obligation (for example, resources\nconsumed, labour hours expended, costs incurred, time elapsed or machine\nhours used) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that\nperformance obligation. If the entity’s efforts or inputs are expended evenly\nthroughout the performance period, it may be appropriate for the entity to\nrecognise revenue on a straight-line basis.B14\nB15\nB16\nB17\nB18IFRS 15\nA794 © IFRS Foundation' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 39}

Therefore, an entity shall exclude from an input method the\neffects of any inputs that, in accordance with the objective of measuring\nprogress in paragraph 39, do not depict the entity’s performance in\ntransferring control of goods or services to the customer. For instance, when\nusing a cost-based input method, an adjustment to the measure of progress\nmay be required in the following circumstances:\n(a) When a cost incurred does not contribute to an entity’s progress in\nsatisfying the performance obligation. For example, an entity would\nnot recognise revenue  on the basis of costs incurred that are\nattributable to significant inefficiencies in the entity’s performance\nthat were not reflected in the price of the contract  (for example, the\ncosts of unexpected amounts of wasted materials, labour or other\nresources that were incurred to satisfy the performance obligation).\n(b) When a cost incurred is not proportionate to the entity’s progress in\nsatisfying the performance obligation. In those circumstances, the best\ndepiction of the entity’s performance may be to adjust the input\nmethod to recognise revenue only to the extent of that cost incurred.\nFor example, a faithful depiction of an entity’s performance might be\nto recognise revenue at an amount equal to the cost of a good used to\nsatisfy a performance obligation if the entity expects at contract\ninception that all of the following conditions would be met:\n(i) the good is not distinct;\n(ii) the customer is expected to obtain control of the good\nsignificantly before receiving services related to the good;\n(iii) the cost of the transferred good is significant relative to the\ntotal expected costs to completely satisfy the performance\nobligation; and\n(iv) the entity procures the good from a third party and is not\nsignificantly involved in designing and manufacturing the good\n(but the entity is acting as a principal in accordance\nwith paragraphs B34–B38).\nSale with a right of return\nIn some contracts , an entity transfers control of a product to a customer  and\nalso grants the customer the right to return the product for various reasons\n(such as dissatisfaction with the product) and receive any combination of the\nfollowing:\n(a) a full or partial refund of any consideration paid;\n(b) a credit that can be applied against amounts owed, or that will be\nowed, to the entity; and\n(c) another product in exchange.B19\nB20IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A795' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 40}

page_content='Warranties\nIt is common for an entity to provide (in accordance with the contract, the law\nor the entity’s customary business practices) a warranty in connection with\nthe sale of a product (whether a good or service). The nature of a warranty can\nvary significantly across industries and contracts. Some warranties provide a\ncustomer  with assurance that the related product will function as the parties\nintended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications. Other\nwarranties provide the customer with a service in addition to the assurance\nthat the product complies with agreed-upon specifications.\nIf a customer  has the option to purchase a warranty separately (for example,\nbecause the warranty is priced or negotiated separately), the warranty is a\ndistinct service because the entity promises to provide the service to the\ncustomer in addition to the product that has the functionality described in the\ncontract . In those circumstances, an entity shall account for the promised\nwarranty as a performance obligation in accordance with paragraphs 22 –30\nand allocate a portion of the transaction price  to that performance obligation\nin accordance with paragraphs 73–86.\nIf a customer  does not have the option to purchase a warranty separately, an\nentity shall account for the warranty in accordance with IAS 37  Provisions,\nContingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  unless the promised warranty, or a\npart of the promised warranty, provides the customer with a service in\naddition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon\nspecifications.\nIn assessing whether a warranty provides a customer  with a service in\naddition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon\nspecifications, an entity shall consider factors such as:\n(a) Whether the warranty is required by law—if the entity is required by\nlaw to provide a warranty, the existence of that law indicates that the\npromised warranty is not a performance obligation because such\nrequirements typically exist to protect customers from the risk of\npurchasing defective products.\n(b) The length of the warranty coverage period—the longer the coverage\nperiod, the more likely it is that the promised warranty is a\nperformance obligation because it is more likely to provide a service in\naddition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon\nspecifications.\n(c) The nature of the tasks that the entity promises to perform—if it is\nnecessary for an entity to perform specified tasks to provide the\nassurance that a product complies with agreed-upon specifications (for\nexample, a return shipping service for a defective product), then those\ntasks likely do not give rise to a performance obligation.\nIf a warranty, or a part of a warranty, provides a customer  with a service in\naddition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon\nspecifications, the promised service is a performance obligation.

For example, a\nmanufacturer might sell products in a jurisdiction in which the law holds the\nmanufacturer liable for any damages (for example, to personal property) that\nmight be caused by a consumer using a product for its intended purpose.\nSimilarly, an entity’s promise to indemnify the customer  for liabilities and\ndamages arising from claims of patent, copyright, trademark or other\ninfringement by the entity’s products does not give rise to a performance\nobligation. The entity shall account for such obligations in accordance with\nIAS 37.\nPrincipal versus agent considerations\nWhen another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer,\nthe entity shall determine whether the nature of its promise is a performance\nobligation  to provide the specified goods or services itself (ie the entity is a\nprincipal) or to arrange for those goods or services to be provided by the other\nparty (ie the entity is an agent). An entity determines whether it is a principal\nor an agent for each specified good or service promised to the customer. A\nspecified good or service is a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of\ngoods or services) to be provided to the customer (see paragraphs 27 –30). If a\ncontract with a customer includes more than one specified good or service, an\nentity could be a principal for some specified goods or services and an agent\nfor others.\nTo determine the nature of its promise (as described in paragraph B34 ), the\nentity shall:\n(a) identify the specified goods or services to be provided to the customer\n(which, for example, could be a right to a good or service to be\nprovided by another party (see paragraph 26)); and\n(b) assess whether it controls (as described in paragraph 33 ) each specified\ngood or service before that good or service is transferred to the\ncustomer.\nAn entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that\ngood or service is transferred to a customer . However, an entity does not\nnecessarily control a specified good if the entity obtains legal title to that good\nonly momentarily before legal title is transferred to a customer. An entity that\nis a principal may satisfy its performance obligation to provide the specified\ngood or service itself or it may engage another party (for example, a\nsubcontractor) to satisfy some or all of the performance obligation on its\nbehalf.B33\nB34\nB34A\nB35IFRS 15\nA798 © IFRS Foundation' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 43}

This is because the\nentity first obtains control of the inputs to the specified good or service\n(which includes goods or services from other parties) and directs their\nuse to create the combined output that is the specified good or service.\nWhen (or as) an entity that is a principal satisfies a performance obligation ,\nthe entity recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it\nexpects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred.\nAn entity is an agent if the entity’s performance obligation is to arrange for\nthe provision of the specified good or service by another party.

This typically includes responsibility for\nthe acceptability of the specified good or service (for example, primary\nresponsibility for the good or service meeting customer specifications).\nIf the entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to\nprovide the specified good or service, this may indicate that the other\nparty involved in providing the specified good or service is acting on\nthe entity’s behalf.B35A\nB35B\nB36\nB37IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A799' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 44}

In those cases, the\nentity has made a marketing offer that it shall account for in accordance with\nthis Standard only when the customer exercises the option to purchase the\nadditional goods or services.\nParagraph 74 requires an entity to allocate the transaction price to\nperformance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. If the\nstand-alone selling price for a customer’s option to acquire additional goods or\nservices is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate it.

Although not determinative, the existence of a shared\neconomic interest (for example, a sales-based royalty) between the entity and\nthe customer related to the intellectual property to which the customer has\nrights may also indicate that the customer could reasonably expect that the\nentity will undertake such activities.\nAn entity’s activities significantly affect the intellectual property to which the\ncustomer has rights when either:\n(a) those activities are expected to significantly change the form (for\nexample, the design or content) or the functionality (for example, the\nability to perform a function or task) of the intellectual property; or\n(b) the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual\nproperty is substantially derived from, or dependent upon, those\nactivities. For example, the benefit from a brand is often derived from,\nor dependent upon, the entity’s ongoing activities that support or\nmaintain the value of the intellectual property.\nAccordingly, if the intellectual property to which the customer has rights has\nsignificant stand-alone functionality, a substantial portion of the benefit of\nthat intellectual property is derived from that functionality. Consequently, the\nability of the customer to obtain benefit from that intellectual property would\nnot be significantly affected by the entity’s activities unless those activities\nsignificantly change its form or functionality.

However, revenue  cannot be recognised for a\nlicence that provides a right to use the entity’s intellectual property before the\nbeginning of the period during which the customer is able to use and benefit\nfrom the licence. For example, if a software licence period begins before an\nentity provides (or otherwise makes available) to the customer a code that\nenables the customer to immediately use the software, the entity would not\nrecognise revenue before that code has been provided (or otherwise made\navailable).\nAn entity shall disregard the following factors when determining whether a\nlicence provides a right to access the entity’s intellectual property or a right to\nuse the entity’s intellectual property:\n(a) Restrictions of time, geographical region or use—those restrictions\ndefine the attributes of the promised licence, rather than define\nwhether the entity satisfies its performance obligation at a point in\ntime or over time.\n(b) Guarantees provided by the entity that it has a valid patent to\nintellectual property and that it will defend that patent from\nunauthorised use—a promise to defend a patent right is not a\nperformance obligation because the act of defending a patent protects\nthe value of the entity’s intellectual property assets and provides\nassurance to the customer  that the licence transferred meets the\nspecifications of the licence promised in the contract.\nSales-based or usage-based royalties\nNotwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs 56 –59, an entity shall\nrecognise revenue  for a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in\nexchange for a licence of intellectual property only when (or as) the later of\nthe following events occurs:\n(a) the subsequent sale or usage occurs; and\n(b) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or\nusage-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially\nsatisfied).\nThe requirement for a sales-based or usage-based royalty in paragraph B63\napplies when the royalty relates only to a licence of intellectual property or\nwhen a licence of intellectual property is the predominant item to which the\nroyalty relates (for example, the licence of intellectual property may be the\npredominant item to which the royalty relates when the entity has a\nreasonable expectation that the customer  would ascribe significantly more\nvalue to the licence than to the other goods or services to which the royalty\nrelates).B62\nB63\nB63AIFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A805' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 50}

The entity shall account for the\nfinancial liability in accordance with IFRS 9.\nTo determine whether a customer  has a significant economic incentive to\nexercise its right, an entity shall consider various factors, including the\nrelationship of the repurchase price to the expected market value of the asset\nat the date of the repurchase and the amount of time until the right expires.\nFor example, if the repurchase price is expected to significantly exceed the\nmarket value of the asset, this may indicate that the customer has a\nsignificant economic incentive to exercise the put option.\nIf the customer  does not have a significant economic incentive to exercise its\nright at a price that is lower than the original selling price of the asset, the\nentity shall account for the agreement as if it were the sale of a product with a\nright of return as described in paragraphs B20–B27.\nIf the repurchase price of the asset is equal to or greater than the original\nselling price and is more than the expected market value of the asset, the\ncontract  is in effect a financing arrangement and, therefore, shall be\naccounted for as described in paragraph B68.\nIf the repurchase price of the asset is equal to or greater than the original\nselling price and is less than or equal to the expected market value of the\nasset, and the customer  does not have a significant economic incentive to\nexercise its right, then the entity shall account for the agreement as if it were\nthe sale of a product with a right of return as described in paragraphs\nB20–B27.\nWhen comparing the repurchase price with the selling price, an entity shall\nconsider the time value of money.\nIf the option lapses unexercised, an entity shall derecognise the liability and\nrecognise revenue.B69\nB70\nB71\nB72\nB73\nB74\nB75\nB76IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A807' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 52}
page_content='Consignment arrangements\nWhen an entity delivers a product to another party (such as a dealer or a\ndistributor) for sale to end customers , the entity shall evaluate whether that\nother party has obtained control of the product at that point in time. A\nproduct that has been delivered to another party may be held in a\nconsignment arrangement if that other party has not obtained control of the\nproduct. Accordingly, an entity shall not recognise revenue  upon delivery of a\nproduct to another party if the delivered product is held on consignment.\nIndicators that an arrangement is a consignment arrangement include, but\nare not limited to, the following:\n(a) the product is controlled by the entity until a specified event occurs,\nsuch as the sale of the product to a customer  of the dealer or until a\nspecified period expires;\n(b) the entity is able to require the return of the product or transfer the\nproduct to a third party (such as another dealer); and\n(c) the dealer does not have an unconditional obligation to pay for the\nproduct (although it might be required to pay a deposit).\nBill-and-hold arrangements\nA bill-and-hold arrangement is a contract  under which an entity bills a\ncustomer  for a product but the entity retains physical possession of the\nproduct until it is transferred to the customer at a point in time in the future.\nFor example, a customer may request an entity to enter into such a contract\nbecause of the customer’s lack of available space for the product or because of\ndelays in the customer’s production schedules.\nAn entity shall determine when it has satisfied its performance obligation to\ntransfer a product by evaluating when a customer  obtains control of that\nproduct (see paragraph 38). For some contracts , control is transferred either\nwhen the product is delivered to the customer’s site or when the product is\nshipped, depending on the terms of the contract (including delivery and\nshipping terms). However, for some contracts, a customer may obtain control\nof a product even though that product remains in an entity’s physical\npossession. In that case, the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and\nobtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the product even\nthough it has decided not to exercise its right to take physical possession of\nthat product. Consequently, the entity does not control the product. Instead,\nthe entity provides custodial services to the customer over the customer’s\nasset.\nIn addition to applying the requirements in paragraph 38, for a customer  to\nhave obtained control of a product in a bill-and-hold arrangement, all of the\nfollowing criteria must be met:\n(a) the reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement must be substantive\n(for example, the customer has requested the arrangement);B77\nB78\nB79\nB80\nB81IFRS 15\nA808 © IFRS Foundation' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 53}
page_content='(b) the product must be identified separately as belonging to the\ncustomer;\n(c) the product currently must be ready for physical transfer to the\ncustomer; and\n(d) the entity cannot have the ability to use the product or to direct it to\nanother customer.\nIf an entity recognises revenue  for the sale of a product on a bill-and-hold\nbasis, the entity shall consider whether it has remaining performance\nobligations  (for example, for custodial services) in accordance with\nparagraphs 22 –30 to which the entity shall allocate a portion of the\ntransaction price in accordance with paragraphs 73–86.\nCustomer acceptance\nIn accordance with paragraph 38(e), a customer’s  acceptance of an asset may\nindicate that the customer has obtained control of the asset. Customer\nacceptance clauses allow a customer to cancel a contract  or require an entity\nto take remedial action if a good or service does not meet agreed-upon\nspecifications. An entity shall consider such clauses when evaluating when a\ncustomer obtains control of a good or service.\nIf an entity can objectively determine that control of a good or service has\nbeen transferred to the customer  in accordance with the agreed-upon\nspecifications in the contract , then customer acceptance is a formality that\nwould not affect the entity’s determination of when the customer has\nobtained control of the good or service. For example, if the customer\nacceptance clause is based on meeting specified size and weight\ncharacteristics, an entity would be able to determine whether those criteria\nhave been met before receiving confirmation of the customer’s acceptance.\nThe entity’s experience with contracts for similar goods or services may\nprovide evidence that a good or service provided to the customer is in\naccordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract. If revenue  is\nrecognised before customer acceptance, the entity still must consider whether\nthere are any remaining performance obligations (for example, installation of\nequipment) and evaluate whether to account for them separately.\nHowever, if an entity cannot objectively determine that the good or service\nprovided to the customer  is in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications\nin the contract , then the entity would not be able to conclude that the\ncustomer has obtained control until the entity receives the customer’s\nacceptance. That is because in that circumstance the entity cannot determine\nthat the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially\nall of the remaining benefits from, the good or service.\nIf an entity delivers products to a customer  for trial or evaluation purposes\nand the customer is not committed to pay any consideration until the trial\nperiod lapses, control of the product is not transferred to the customer until\neither the customer accepts the product or the trial period lapses.B82\nB83\nB84\nB85\nB86IFRS 15\n© IFRS Foundation A809' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 54}
page_content='Disclosure of disaggregated revenue\nParagraph 114 requires an entity to disaggregate revenue  from contracts  with\ncustomers  into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and\nuncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nConsequently, the extent to which an entity’s revenue is disaggregated for the\npurposes of this disclosure depends on the facts and circumstances that\npertain to the entity’s contracts with customers. Some entities may need to\nuse more than one type of category to meet the objective in paragraph 114 for\ndisaggregating revenue. Other entities may meet the objective by using only\none type of category to disaggregate revenue.\nWhen selecting the type of category (or categories) to use to disaggregate\nrevenue , an entity shall consider how information about the entity’s revenue\nhas been presented for other purposes, including all of the following:\n(a) disclosures presented outside the financial statements (for example, in\nearnings releases, annual reports or investor presentations);\n(b) information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker\nfor evaluating the financial performance of operating segments; and\n(c) other information that is similar to the types of information identified\nin paragraph B88(a) and (b) and that is used by the entity or users of\nthe entity’s financial statements to evaluate the entity’s financial\nperformance or make resource allocation decisions.\nExamples of categories that might be appropriate include, but are not limited\nto, all of the following:\n(a) type of good or service (for example, major product lines);\n(b) geographical region (for example, country or region);\n(c) market or type of customer  (for example, government and non-\ngovernment customers);\n(d) type of contract  (for example, fixed-price and time-and-materials\ncontracts);\n(e) contract duration (for example, short-term and long-term contracts);\n(f) timing of transfer of goods or services (for example, revenue  from\ngoods or services transferred to customers at a point in time and\nrevenue from goods or services transferred over time); and\n(g) sales channels (for example, goods sold directly to consumers and\ngoods sold through intermediaries).B87\nB88\nB89IFRS 15\nA810 © IFRS Foundation' metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lit/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf', 'page': 55}
