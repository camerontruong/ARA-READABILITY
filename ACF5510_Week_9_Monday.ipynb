The increase of 1 bps was driven by deposit \\nmargin management across all divisions, favourable wholesale funding costs, and a reduction in lower margin Markets average interest \\nearning assets as a result of lower reverse repurchase agreements. This was partially offset by growth in lower yielding liquid assets and the \\nimpact of low interest rates on earnings on capital and replicating deposits. Average interest earning assets increased $0.8 billion driven by \\nhigher central bank balances, higher liquid assets, and home lending growth across the New Zealand and Australia Retail and Commercial \\ndivisions.

The 2020 financial year included a loss on sale of the UDC business.  \\nDivested business  The 2020 financial year included the divested business results of UDC.  \\nresults \\nCustomer  Customer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and \\nremediation  related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes. \\nLitigation  During the 2021 financial year, the Group reached an agreement to settle a United States class action related to \\nsettlements  the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW) and the trading of BBSW-based products. The settlement is without admission of \\nliability and remains subject to negotiation and execution of complete settlement terms as well as court approval. \\nThe Group recognised a provision in relation to the settlement and related expenses during the year. \\nAccelerated software  During the 2020 financial year, the Group recognised an accelerated amortisation charge arising from the revised \\namortisation  application of the Group’s software amortisation policy in the 2020 financial year reflecting the shorter useful life of \\nsoftware caused by rapidly changing technology and business requirements.  \\nAsian associate  During the 2020 financial year, the Group recognised an impairment in respect of two of the Group’s investments \\nimpairments  to adjust their carrying values in line with their value-in-use calculations. No further impairments were recognised \\nin the 2021 financial year (refer to Note 26 Investments in Associates in the Financial Report for further details). \\nAsian associate items  The Group recognised the following adjustments to equity accounted earnings from its Asian associates:  \\n\\uf0b7  AmBank 1MDB settlement: following AMMB Holdings Berhad’s (AmBank) agreement with the Malaysian \\nMinistry of Finance to resolve potential claims relating to its involvement with 1Malaysia Development Berhad \\n(1MDB), the Group recognised a $212 million reduction in equity accounted earnings after tax reflecting its \\nshare of the settlement provision during the 2021 financial year. \\n\\uf0b7  AmBank goodwill impairment: during the 2021 financial year, AmBank partially impaired goodwill and the \\nGroup recognised a $135 million reduction in equity accounted earnings after tax reflecting its share of the \\nimpairment.  \\n\\uf0b7  PT Panin AASB 9 adjustment: when the Group adopted AASB 9 Financial Instruments on 1 October 2018, an \\nestimate of PT Bank Pan Indonesia (PT Panin)’s transition adjustment was recognised through opening retained \\nearnings to align accounting policies. PT Panin adopted AASB 9 during the 2020 financial year recognising a \\ntransition adjustment in retained earnings. The $66 million represents the Group’s equity accounted share of \\nthe transition adjustment net of amounts previously adjusted by the Group on 1 October 2018. \\nLease-related items  Following the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (AASB 16) on 1 October 2019, the Group recognised \\nadditional charges which were presented as a large/notable item at the time as the 2019 comparatives were \\nprepared under the previous lease accounting standard (AASB 117). The ongoing AASB 16 impacts for the 2020 \\nfinancial year are now presented on a consistent basis to the 2021 financial year. The residual lease related item \\nrelates to non-recurring items recognised in the 2020 financial year. \\nRestructuring  Restructuring charges largely related to business and property changes in Australia Retail and Commercial division \\nand operational changes in Technology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre division.  \\nGoodwill write-off  The Group recognised the following goodwill write-off during the 2020 financial year:  \\n\\uf0b7  Pacific division: the impact of COVID-19 on the economies of the Pacific region had been significant and \\nconditions were expected to take some time to recover. Goodwill of $50 million was impaired.  \\n\\uf0b7  New Zealand division: as a result of changes in the economic environment and outlook, the Group announced \\nits intention to begin winding up the Bonus Bonds business in the New Zealand division by 31 October 2020. \\nAs a result, the Group wrote off the associated goodwill of $27 million. \\n60\\n60           ANZ 2021 ANNUAL REPORT OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER   \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION OUR PERFORMANCE (continued) \\nANALYSIS OF CASH PROFIT PERFORMANCE \\nNet interest income \\nGROUP NET INTEREST MARGIN FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (bps) \\n1\\n7 0\\n6\\n164\\n163\\n(7) (1)\\n159\\n(5)\\n2020 Cash Wholesale Asset Asset and Liquidity Impact of 2021 Cash Markets Large/ 2021 Cash\\nnet interest funding & pricing funding mix rates net of net interest Balance notable net interest\\nmargin deposit repricing margin  Sheet items margin\\npricing subtotal activities1\\n \\n1.

A disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example: \\n\\uf0b7  the amount is significant in size (quantitative factor); \\n\\uf0b7  the information is significant by nature (qualitative factor); \\n\\uf0b7  the user cannot understand the Group’s results without the specific disclosure (qualitative factor); \\n\\uf0b7  the information is critical to a user’s understanding of the impact of significant changes in the Group’s business during the period - for example, \\nbusiness acquisitions or disposals (qualitative factor); \\n\\uf0b7  the information relates to an aspect of the Group’s operations that is important to its future performance (qualitative factor); and \\n\\uf0b7  the information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or by the Group’s principal \\nregulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). \\nThis section of the financial statements: \\n\\uf0b7  outlines the basis upon which the Group’s financial statements have been prepared; and \\n\\uf0b7  discusses any new accounting standards or regulations that directly impact the financial statements. \\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\nThis financial report is a general purpose (Tier 1) financial report prepared by a ‘for profit’ entity, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards \\n(AASs) and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), the Corporations Act 2001, and International \\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). \\nWe present the financial statements of the Group in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. We have \\nrounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors \\nReport) Instrument 2016/191. We measure the financial statements of each entity in the Group using the currency of the primary economic \\nenvironment in which that entity operates (the functional currency). \\nBASIS OF MEASUREMENT \\nWe have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have \\nstated at their fair value: \\n\\uf0b7  derivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment made to the underlying hedged item; \\n\\uf0b7  financial instruments held for trading; \\n\\uf0b7  financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss; \\n\\uf0b7  financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income; and \\n\\uf0b7  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale (except those at carrying value). \\nIn accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits (AASB 119) we have measured defined benefit obligations using the Projected Unit \\nCredit Method. \\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  \\nThe sale of Wealth Australia business to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF) and Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) completed across 2020 and \\n2019. The financial results of these divested businesses are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective.  \\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION \\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. An entity, including a \\nstructured entity, is considered a subsidiary of the Group when we determine that the Company has control over the entity. Control exists when the \\nGroup is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its \\npower over the entity. We assess power by examining existing rights that give the Company the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the \\nentity. We have eliminated, on consolidation, the effect of all transactions between entities in the Group. \\n120\\n120 OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW HHOOWW  WWEE     PPEERRFFOORRMMAANNCCEE   RREEMMUUNNEERRAATTIIOONN   DDIIRREECCTTOORRSS’’   FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL   SSHHAARREEHHOOLLDDEERR    ANZ 2021 ANNUAL REPORT \\nCCRREEAATTEE  VVAALLUUEE OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW RREEPPOORRTT RREEPPOORRTT RREEPPOORRTT IINNFFOORRMMAATTIIOONN\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued)\\n \\n1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  \\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  \\nTRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES   \\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the \\nreporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the relevant spot rate. \\nAny foreign currency translation gains or losses that arise are included in profit or loss in the period they arise. \\nWe measure translation differences on non-monetary items at fair value through profit or loss and report them as part of the fair value gain or loss on \\nthese items. For non-monetary items classified as investment securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, translation \\ndifferences are included in other comprehensive income. \\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT HAVE A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY THAT IS NOT AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS \\nThe financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars for consolidation into the Group Financial Statements using the \\nfollowing method: \\nForeign currency item     Exchange rate used \\nAssets and liabilities  The reporting date rate \\nEquity   The initial investment date rate \\nIncome and expenses  The average rate for the period – but if for a significant transaction we believe the average rate is not \\nreasonable, then we use the rate at the date of the transaction \\nExchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations are recognised in the foreign currency translation \\nreserve in equity. When we dispose of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences are transferred to profit or loss. \\nFIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES \\nThe Group provides fiduciary services to third parties including custody, nominee and trustee services. This involves the Group holding assets on \\nbehalf of third parties and making decisions regarding the purchase and sale of financial instruments. If ANZ is not the beneficial owner or does not \\ncontrol the assets, then we do not recognise these transactions in these financial statements, except when required by accounting standards or \\nanother legislative requirement. \\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES \\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates and \\nassumptions about past and future events. Further information on the key judgements and estimates that we consider material to the \\nfinancial statements are contained within each relevant note to the financial statements. \\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic  \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing effects on the global economy has continued to impact our customers, operations and Group \\nperformance. Governments have responded at unprecedented levels to protect the health of the population, local economies and \\nlivelihoods. The course of the pandemic and vaccination levels has varied across the globe and government responses have differed in \\ntheir extent and timing. Economies are reopening at different rates whilst the risk of subsequent waves of infection remain. Thus there \\nremains an elevated level of estimation uncertainty involved in the preparation of these financial statements including: \\n\\uf0b7  the extent and duration of the disruption to business arising from the actions of governments, businesses and consumers in the \\nongoing management of the virus;  \\n\\uf0b7  the impact and expected response of the economy (and forecasts of key economic factors including GDP, employment and house \\nprices). This includes the response of capital markets, and the impacts on credit quality, liquidity, unemployment, consumer spending, \\nas well as specific sector impacts; and \\n\\uf0b7  the efficacy of vaccines against variants of the virus, and the effectiveness of government and central bank measures to support \\nbusinesses and consumers through this disruption. \\nThe Group has made various accounting estimates in this Financial Report based on forecasts of economic conditions which reflect \\nexpectations and assumptions as at 30 September 2021 about future events that the Directors believe are reasonable in the circumstances. \\nThere is a considerable degree of judgement involved in preparing these estimates. The underlying assumptions are also subject to \\nuncertainties which are outside the control of the Group. Accordingly, actual economic conditions are likely to be different from those \\nforecast since anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected, and the effect of those differences may significantly impact \\naccounting estimates included in these financial statements. \\nThe significant accounting estimates impacted by these forecasts and associated uncertainties are predominantly related to expected \\ncredit losses and recoverable amounts of non-financial assets. \\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each of these estimates is discussed further in the relevant note of these financial statements. \\nReaders should carefully consider these disclosures in light of the inherent uncertainty described above.\\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 121\\n121  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER   ANZ 2021 ANNUAL REPORT \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n   \\n1.

Further details of these are \\nset out below. \\nGENERAL HEDGE ACCOUNTING \\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management \\nactivities undertaken when hedging both financial and non-financial risks. AASB 9 provides the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue to \\napply the AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) hedge accounting requirements until the International \\nAccounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Group continues to apply the hedge accounting \\nrequirements of AASB 139. \\nAASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17) \\nThe final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Group until 1 October 2023. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, \\nAASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, \\npresentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. \\nThe measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although \\nthe overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change. \\nAASB 17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Group. \\n124\\n124 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED (continued) \\nDEFERRED TAX RELATED TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM A SINGLE TRANSACTION \\nAASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction \\namends AASB 112 Income Taxes and clarifies that entities are required to recognise deferred tax on transactions for which there is both an asset and a \\nliability and that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. This may include transactions such as leases and decommissioning \\nor restoration obligations. This amendment is effective for the Group from 1 October 2023 and is not expected to have a significant impact. \\nCHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY \\nINTRAGROUP TRANSACTIONS WITH CONSOLIDATED SECURITISATION ENTITIES \\nDuring the year, the Company changed its accounting policy relating to intragroup transactions with consolidated securitisation structured entities \\n(SEs) in which it holds all the instruments issued by the SE. The Company will no longer separately record a liability to pass the cash flows from the \\nunderlying loans to the SE and an asset in the form of notes issued by the SE which entitle the Company to those same cash flows. Rather the \\ntransactions will be considered together with the Company recording a net nil position with the SE in order to better reflect the economic substance \\nof the intragroup transactions that are fully offsetting. Comparatives have been restated in the financial statements of the Company. There has been \\nno change to the Group because the relevant securitisation SEs are fully consolidated and the intra-group transactions eliminated. Refer to Note 35 \\nImpact of Adoption of New Standards and Other Changes for further details of this change. \\n \\n \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 125\\n125 2.

We use the effective \\ninterest rate method to calculate the amortised cost of assets held at amortised cost and to recognise interest income on financial assets \\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated \\nfuture cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net \\ncarrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of \\nhistorical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio - taking into account contractual obligations and prepayment experience. \\nWe recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the \\neffective interest rate method. These are presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial \\ninstrument is a financial asset or financial liability. \\nMajor Bank Levy \\nThe Major Bank Levy Act 2017 (‘Levy’ or ‘Major bank levy’) applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of the Company. The Group has \\ndetermined that the levy represents a finance cost for the Group and the Company and it is presented as interest expense in the Income \\nStatement. \\n \\n \\n126\\n126 3.

NON-INTEREST INCOME  (continued)  \\n\\xa0\\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT   \\nOTHER OPERATING INCOME \\nFee and Commission Revenue \\nWe recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers (a) over time when the performance obligation is \\nsatisfied across more than one reporting period or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is \\nsatisfied within one reporting period.  \\n\\uf0b7  lending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and \\ncommitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon, and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct \\ngood or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product (including annual package fees that provide \\nbenefits on other ANZ products). \\n\\uf0b7  non-lending fees includes fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific \\ncustomer transactions such as international money transfers. Where the Group provides multiple goods or services to a customer under \\nthe same contract, the Group allocates the transaction price of the contract to distinct performance obligations based on the relative \\nstand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. \\n\\uf0b7  commissions represent fees from third parties where we act as an agent by arranging a third party (such as an insurance provider) to \\nprovide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, we are not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service \\nto the customer. If the Group collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, we only recognise the net commission it \\nretains as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside our control (such as a trail commission), revenue is only \\nrecognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods. \\n\\uf0b7  funds management income represents fees earned from customers for providing financial advice and fees for asset management \\nservices and advice provided to investment funds. Revenue is recognised either at the point the financial advice is provided or over the \\nperiod in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities are only \\nrecognised when it becomes highly probable the performance hurdle will be achieved. \\nNet Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income \\nWe recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income: \\n\\uf0b7  exchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and translation differences on monetary items translated at rates \\ndifferent to those at which they were initially recognised or included in a previous financial report; \\n\\uf0b7  fair value movements (excluding realised and accrued interest) on derivatives that we use to manage interest rate and foreign exchange \\nrisk on funding instruments not designated as accounting hedges; \\n\\uf0b7  the ineffective portions of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges; \\n\\uf0b7  immediately upon sale or repayment of a hedged item, the unamortised fair value adjustments in items designated as fair value hedges \\nand amounts accumulated in equity related to designated cash flow hedges;  \\n\\uf0b7  fair value movements on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss or held for trading; \\n\\uf0b7  amounts released from the fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) reserve when a debt instrument classified as FVOCI \\nis sold; and \\n\\uf0b7  the gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets or liabilities measured at amortised cost. \\nGain or Loss on Disposal of Non-Financial Assets \\nThe gain or loss on the disposal of assets is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the proceeds of disposal net of costs.  \\nThis is recognised in Other income in the year in which the significant risks and rewards from the asset transfer to the buyer. \\nWhen a non-financial asset or group of assets is classified as held for sale, the difference between the carrying value immediately prior to \\nreclassification and the fair value less costs to sell is recognised in Other operating income to align with the classification of gain or loss on \\nsale that would have applied if the sale had completed during the year.\\n128\\n128 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n3.

OPERATING EXPENSES (continued) \\n \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT \\nOPERATING EXPENSES \\nOperating expenses are recognised as services are provided to the Group, over the period in which an asset is consumed, or once a liability \\nis created. \\nSALARIES AND RELATED COSTS - ANNUAL LEAVE, LONG SERVICE LEAVE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS \\nWages and salaries, annual leave and other employee entitlements expected to be paid or settled within twelve months of employees \\nrendering service are measured at their nominal amounts using remuneration rates that the Group expects to pay when the liabilities are \\nsettled. \\nWe accrue employee entitlements relating to long service leave using an actuarial calculation. It includes assumptions regarding staff \\ndepartures, leave utilisation and future salary increases. The result is then discounted using market yields at the reporting date. The market \\nyields are determined from a blended rate of high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that closely match the estimated future \\ncash outflows. \\nIf we expect to pay short term cash bonuses, then a liability is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to \\npay this amount (as a result of past service provided by the employee) and the obligation can be reliably measured. \\nPersonnel expenses also include share-based payments which may be cash or equity settled. We calculate the fair value of equity settled \\nremuneration at grant date, which is then amortised over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share capital or the share \\noption reserve as applicable. When we estimate the fair value, we take into account market vesting conditions, such as share price \\nperformance conditions. We take non-market vesting conditions, such as service conditions, into account by adjusting the number of \\nequity instruments included in the expense. \\nAfter the grant of an equity-based award, the amount we recognise as an expense is reversed when non-market vesting conditions are not \\nmet, for example an employee fails to satisfy the minimum service period specified in the award on resignation, termination or notice of \\ndismissal for serious misconduct. However, we do not reverse the expense if the award does not vest due to the failure to meet a market-\\nbased performance condition. \\nFurther information on share-based payment schemes operated by the Group during the current and prior year is included in Note 31 \\nEmployee Share and Option Plans. \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 131\\n131 5.

INCOME TAX (continued) \\nTAX CONSOLIDATION \\nThe Company and all its wholly owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax-consolidated group under Australian taxation law. The Company is \\nthe head entity in the tax-consolidated group. We recognise each of the following in the separate financial statements of members of the tax \\nconsolidated group on a ‘group allocation’ basis: tax expense/income, and deferred tax liabilities/assets that arise from temporary differences of the \\nmembers of the tax-consolidated group. The Company (as head entity in the tax-consolidated group) recognises current tax liabilities and assets of \\nthe tax-consolidated group. \\nUnder a tax funding arrangement between the entities in the tax-consolidated group, amounts are recognised as payable to or receivable by the \\nCompany and each member of the tax-consolidated group in relation to the tax contribution amounts paid or payable between the Company and \\nthe other members of the tax-consolidated group. \\nMembers of the tax-consolidated group have also entered into a tax sharing agreement that provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities \\nbetween the entities were the head entity to default on its income tax payment obligations. \\nUNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets related to unused realised tax losses (on revenue account) total $6 million (2020: $10 million) for the Group and  \\n$2 million (2020: $5 million) for the Company. \\nUnrecognised deferred tax liabilities related to additional potential foreign tax costs (assuming all retained earnings in offshore branches and \\nsubsidiaries are repatriated) total $344 million (2020: $329 million) for the Group and $15 million (2020: $14 million) for the Company. \\n \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT \\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE \\nIncome tax expense comprises both current and deferred taxes and is based on the accounting profit adjusted for differences in the \\naccounting and tax treatments of income and expenses (that is, taxable income). We recognise tax expense in profit or loss except when \\nthe tax relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case we recognise the tax directly in \\nequity or other comprehensive income respectively. \\nCURRENT TAX EXPENSE \\nCurrent tax is the tax we expect to pay on taxable income for the year, based on tax rates (and tax laws) which are enacted at the reporting \\ndate. We recognise current tax as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or refundable). \\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\nWe account for deferred tax using the balance sheet method. Deferred tax arises because the accounting income is not always the same as \\nthe taxable income. This creates temporary differences, which usually reverse over time. Until they reverse, we recognise a deferred tax \\nasset, or liability, on the balance sheet. We measure deferred taxes at the tax rates that we expect will apply to the period(s) when the asset \\nis realised, or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. \\nWe offset current and deferred tax assets and liabilities only to the extent that:  \\n\\uf0b7  they relate to income taxes imposed by the same taxation authority;  \\n\\uf0b7  there is a legal right and intention to settle on a net basis; and \\n\\uf0b7  it is allowed under the tax law of the relevant jurisdiction. \\n \\n \\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES \\nJudgement is required in determining provisions held in respect of uncertain tax positions.

Instalment tax \\npayments on account of the 2021 financial year, which will be made after 30 September 2021, will generate sufficient franking credits to enable the \\nfinal 2021 dividend to be fully franked. The extent to which future dividends will be franked will depend on a number of factors, including the level of \\nprofits generated by the Group that will be subject to tax in Australia. \\n \\nRESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS \\nAPRA’s written approval is required before paying dividends on ANZ ordinary shares if: \\n\\uf0b7  the aggregate dividends exceed the Company’s after tax earnings (in calculating those after tax earnings, we take into account any payments we \\nmade on senior capital instruments) in the financial year to which they relate; or \\n\\uf0b7  the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio falls within capital range buffers specified by APRA. \\nIf the Company fails to pay a dividend or distribution on its ANZ Capital Notes or ANZ Capital Securities on the scheduled payment date, it may \\n(subject to a number of exceptions) be restricted from resolving to pay or paying any dividend on the ANZ ordinary shares. \\nIn response to the uncertain impacts of COVID-19, in July 2020 APRA provided guidance on capital management, including its expectations in relation \\nto limits on the amount of dividends to be paid out of that year’s earnings. The Company’s 2020 interim dividend of 25 cents per share (paid to \\nshareholders on 30 September 2020) and 2020 final dividend of 35 cents per share (paid to shareholders on 16 December 2020) took into account this \\nguidance. \\nFollowing an improvement in the economic outlook and stability in financial markets, APRA updated their guidance in December 2020, whereby from \\nthe 2021 calendar year, APRA will no longer hold ADIs to a minimum level of earnings retention but emphasised the requirement for ADIs to maintain \\nvigilance and careful planning in capital management, including conducting regular stress testing and assurance on the capacity to continue to lend. \\nAPRA also stated that the onus will be on Boards to consider carefully the sustainable rate for dividends, taking into account the outlook for \\nprofitability, capital and economic environment. \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 135\\n135 7.

Financial assets are classified into these measurement classifications on the basis \\nof two criteria:  \\n\\uf0b7  the business model within which the financial asset is managed; and  \\n\\uf0b7  the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments \\nof principal and interest).  \\nThe resultant financial asset classifications are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7  Amortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held \\nin a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;  \\n\\uf0b7  FVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held in a \\nbusiness model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and  \\n\\uf0b7  FVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.  \\nFair value option for financial assets \\nA financial asset may be irrevocably designated on initial recognition: \\n\\uf0b7  at FVTPL when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise; or \\n\\uf0b7  at FVOCI for investments in equity securities, where that instrument is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised \\nby an acquirer in a business combination. \\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n9.

The seller has the \\ncorresponding obligation to fulfil the transaction to sell or buy the asset or instrument if the buyer exercises             \\nthe option. \\n\\xa0  \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 143\\n143  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n11. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued) \\nRISKS MANAGED   \\nThe Group offers and uses the instruments described above to manage fluctuations in the following market factors: \\nForeign Exchange  Currencies at current or determined rates of exchange. \\nInterest Rate  Fixed or variable interest rates applying to money lent, deposited or borrowed. \\nCommodity  Soft commodities (that is, agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa and sugar) and hard commodities (that \\nis, mined products such as gold, oil and gas). \\nCredit   Risk of default by customers or third parties. \\n \\nThe Group uses a number of central clearing counterparties and exchanges to settle derivative transactions. Different arrangements for posting of \\ncollateral exist with these exchanges:  \\n\\uf0b7  some transactions are subject to clearing arrangements which result in separate recognition of collateral assets and liabilities, with the carrying \\nvalues of the associated derivative assets and liabilities held at their fair value.  \\n\\uf0b7  other transactions, are legally settled by the payment or receipt of collateral which reduces the carrying values of the related derivative instruments \\nby the amount paid or received.  \\nIn August 2021, the Group amended the terms of its legal agreements with one of its central clearing counterparties giving effect to this form of legal \\nsettlement. As a result of this change, collateral paid and received by the Group under these agreements is no longer separately recognised, instead \\nsettling the Group’s outstanding derivative exposures and reducing the associated carrying values of the derivative asset and liability balances. The \\nimpact of this change as at 30 September 2021 is a reduction in derivative assets of $55.1 billion, derivative liabilities of $55.2 billion, and a reduction in \\nnet collateral paid of $0.1 billion. \\n144\\n144 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n11.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued) \\n \\n \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT \\nRecognition   Initially and at each reporting date, we recognise all derivatives at fair value. If the fair value of a \\n  derivative is positive, then we carry it as an asset, but if its value is negative, then we carry it as a \\n  liability.  \\n \\nValuation adjustments are integral in determining the fair value of derivatives. This includes: \\n \\n  \\uf0b7  a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) to reflect the counterparty risk and/or event of default; and \\n  \\uf0b7  a funding valuation adjustment (FVA) to account for funding costs and benefits in the derivatives \\n \\nportfolio. \\nDerecognition of  We remove derivative assets from our balance sheet when the contracts expire or we have transferred \\nassets and liabilities  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. We remove derivative liabilities from our balance \\n  sheet when the Group’s contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired. \\nWith respect to derivatives cleared through a central clearing counterparty or exchange, derivative \\nassets or liabilities may be derecognised in accordance with the principle above when collateral is \\nsettled, depending on the legal arrangements in place for each instrument. \\nImpact on the   The recognition of gains or losses on derivative financial instruments depends on whether the \\nIncome Statement  derivative is held for trading or is designated in a hedging relationship. For derivative financial \\ninstruments held for trading, gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or \\nloss.  \\nFor an instrument designated in a hedging relationship, the recognition of gains or losses depends on \\nthe nature of the item being hedged. Refer to the table on page 147 for profit or loss treatment for \\neach hedge type. \\nSources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from differences in the interest rate reference rate, margins, \\nor rate set differences and differences in discounting between the hedged items and the hedging \\ninstruments. The hedging instruments are discounted using Overnight Index Swaps discount curves \\nwhich are not applied to the hedged items. \\nHedge effectiveness  To qualify for hedge accounting, a hedge is expected to be highly effective. A hedge is highly effective \\n  only if the following conditions are met: \\n \\n\\uf0b7  the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash \\n \\nflows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated \\n \\n(prospective effectiveness); and \\n \\n  \\uf0b7  the actual results of the hedge are within the range of 80-125% (retrospective effectiveness). \\n \\nThe Group monitors hedge effectiveness on a regular basis but at a minimum at least at each \\nreporting date.  \\n \\n \\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES   \\nJudgement is required when we select the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of derivatives, particularly the selection of \\nvaluation inputs that are not readily observable, and the application of valuation adjustments to certain derivatives.

Subsequently, we then \\nmeasure loans and advances at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, or \\nat fair value when they are specifically designated on initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss or when held for trading. \\nWe classify contracts to lease assets and hire purchase agreements as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of \\nownership of the asset to the customer or an unrelated third party. We include these facilities in ‘Other’ in the table above. \\nThe Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets that are recognised on its balance sheet. When the Group retains \\nsubstantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets remain on the Group’s balance sheet, however if \\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards are transferred, the Group derecognises the asset. If the risks and rewards are partially retained and \\ncontrol over the asset is lost, the Group derecognises the asset. If control over the asset is not lost, the Group continues to recognise the \\nasset to the extent of its continuing involvement. \\nWe separately recognise the rights and obligations retained, or created, in the transfer of assets and liabilities as appropriate. \\nAssets disclosed as net loans and advances are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for financial assets outlined on \\npage 141. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with loans and advances at amortised cost are recognised and measured in \\naccordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 14 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses. \\n158\\n158 14.

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued) \\n \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT \\nEXPECTED CREDIT LOSS MODEL \\nThe measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and \\ntakes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.  \\nExpected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit \\ndeterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach: \\n\\uf0b7  Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since origination, \\nan allowance equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are \\npossible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, \\nexpected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity. \\n\\uf0b7  Stage 2: Where there has been a SICR since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit \\nlosses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a \\nsubsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a \\nStage 1 classification and a 12 month ECL applies. \\n\\uf0b7  Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised. \\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis \\nwhen transferred to Stage 3. \\nMEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS \\nECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:  \\n\\uf0b7  Probability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period; \\n\\uf0b7  Exposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, \\nexpected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and \\n\\uf0b7  Loss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, \\ntaking into account direct and indirect recovery costs.  \\nThese credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward-looking information through the use of macro-economic variables. \\nEXPECTED LIFE \\nWhen estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk. \\nFor non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For \\nnon-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group’s contractual right to withdraw a \\nfacility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period. \\nFor retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using a behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour \\nand substantial modifications. \\nDEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS \\nThe definition of default used in measuring expected credit losses is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management \\npurposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators \\nthat a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due. \\nFinancial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default.  \\nWhen there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the \\nGroup’s internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of \\namounts previously written-off are credited to credit impairment charge in the income statement. \\n   \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 163\\n163  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n14. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)  \\n \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT \\nMODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS \\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, \\nan assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment \\nconsiders both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, \\nchanges in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the \\nexisting financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is \\nconsidered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the \\nmodification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset. \\nSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR) \\nStage 2 assets are those that have experienced a SICR since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both \\nqualitative and quantitative information: \\ni.  Internal credit rating grade \\nFor the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility \\nsince origination and is measured by application of thresholds.  \\nFor non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date \\nto the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the probability of default of the borrower \\nand incorporates both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward-looking information. CCRs are subject to \\nreview at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer.  \\nFor retail portfolios, a SICR is determined, depending on the type of facility, by either comparing the scenario weighted lifetime \\nprobability of default at the reporting date to that at origination, or by reference to customer behavioural score thresholds. The \\nscenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:  \\n\\uf0b7  there has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or \\n\\uf0b7  there has been a deterioration in the customer’s overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations. \\nii.  Backstop criteria \\nThe Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criterion for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, \\nfacilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1. \\niii.  COVID-19 initiatives \\nFacilities previously subject to the COVID-19 repayment deferral arrangements have been subsumed into the normal loan portfolios \\nand SICR applied accordingly.   \\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION \\nForward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a SICR since its initial \\nrecognition and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward-looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probability-\\nweighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:  \\ni.  Base case scenario \\nThe base case scenario is ANZ’s view of future macro-economic conditions. It reflects management’s assumptions used for strategic \\nplanning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the \\nGroup applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3-year time horizon;  \\nii.  Upside and iii. Downside scenarios \\nThe upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the \\neconomic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and \\npessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and \\niv. Severe downside scenario \\nThe severe downside scenario is fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions and accounts for the potentially severe \\nimpact of less likely extremely adverse economic conditions. It reflects macro-economic conditions of a downturn economic event \\nwith a probability of occurrence once every 25 years. \\n   \\n164\\n164 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n14. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued) \\n \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT (continued) \\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION (continued) \\nThe four scenarios are described in terms of macro-economic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) \\ndepending on the lending portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth \\nrates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices.  \\nProbability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case \\neconomic scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) is \\nresponsible for reviewing and approving the base case economic scenario and the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) approves the \\nprobability weights applied to each scenario. \\nWhere applicable, temporary adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been \\nadequately addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments. \\n \\n \\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES \\nIn estimating collectively assessed ECL, the Group makes judgements and assumptions in relation to: \\n\\uf0b7  the selection of an estimation technique or modelling methodology; and \\n\\uf0b7  the selection of inputs for those models, and the interdependencies between those inputs. \\nThe following table summarises the key judgements and assumptions in relation to the model inputs and the interdependencies between \\nthose inputs, and highlights significant changes during the current period. \\nThe judgements and associated assumptions have been made within the context of the impact of COVID-19, and reflect historical \\nexperience and other factors that are considered to be relevant, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable \\nunder the circumstances.

The key consideration for probability weightings in the current period is the effectiveness of actions taken in response \\nto COVID-19 relaxation of containment measures by governments, and the take-up of vaccines limiting the impact of the virus. \\nThe base case scenario represents a significant improvement in the forecasts since September 2020. Given the uncertainties associated \\nwith a potential ongoing recovery in the economy, the average base case weighting across geographies has been reduced to 41.3% (Sep \\n20: 50.0%) and the downside scenario increased to 47.7% (Sep 20: 33.3%). \\nThe assigned probability weightings in Australia, New Zealand and Rest of world are subject to a high degree of inherent uncertainty and \\ntherefore the actual outcomes may be significantly different to those projected. The Group considers these weightings in each geography \\nto provide estimates of the possible loss outcomes and taking into account short and long term inter-relationships within the Group’s \\ncredit portfolios.

As ANZ NZ did not exercise its option to convert in May 2020, the terms of the ANZ NZ CNs provide for their conversion \\ninto a variable number of shares of the Company in May 2022 subject to certain conditions. \\nThe RBNZ has released new capital adequacy requirements for New Zealand banks, which are being implemented from October 2021 to July 2028. \\nUnder these changes, from 1 January 2022, the ANZ NZ CNs are subject to a reduction in their regulatory capital recognition, and as a result, ANZ NZ \\nhas determined that a Regulatory Event (as defined in the ANZ NZ CN Deed Poll) has occurred in respect of these notes. The occurrence of a \\nRegulatory Event means that ANZ NZ may choose to redeem the ANZ NZ CNs at its discretion. A redemption of the ANZ NZ CNs is subject to certain \\nconditions, including approval from the RBNZ and APRA. At the date of this financial report, no decision had been made on whether ANZ NZ will \\nredeem the ANZ NZ CNs (subject to regulatory approvals). \\n \\n174\\n174 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n16.

DEBT ISSUANCES\\xa0(continued)\\xa0\\n \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT \\nDebt issuances are measured at amortised cost, except where designated at fair value through profit or loss. Where the Group enters into a \\nfair value hedge accounting relationship, the fair value attributable to the hedge risk is reflected in adjustments to the carrying value of the \\ndebt. Interest expense is recognised using the effective interest rate method.   \\nSubordinated debt with capital-based conversion features (i.e. Common Equity Capital Trigger Events or Non-Viability Trigger Events) are \\nconsidered to contain embedded derivatives that we account for separately at fair value through profit and loss. The embedded \\nderivatives arise because the amount of shares issued on conversion following any of those trigger events is subject to the maximum \\nconversion number, however they have no significant value as of the reporting date given the remote nature of those trigger events.  \\n176\\n176 17 Financial risk management\\nOVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n17.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) \\nOVERVIEW \\nAN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  \\nThis overview is provided to aid the users of the financial statements in understanding the context of the financial disclosures required under AASB 7 \\nFinancial Instruments: Disclosures (AASB 7). It should be read in conjunction with the Governance and Risk Management sections of this Annual \\nReport. \\nThe Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Board has delegated authority to the \\nBoard Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The BRC reports regularly to the Board \\non its activities. \\nThe Board approves the strategic objectives of the Group including: \\n\\uf0b7  the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of \\nits strategic objectives and business plan; and  \\n\\uf0b7  the Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes ANZ’s strategy for managing risks and the key elements of the RMF that give effect to this \\nstrategy. This includes a description of each material risk, and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant \\npolicies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how ANZ identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and controls or \\nmitigates material risks. \\nThe Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and robust control environment in which \\nall employees understand their roles and obligations. At ANZ, risk is everyone’s responsibility. \\nThe Group has an independent risk management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer who: \\n\\uf0b7  is responsible for overseeing the risk profile and the risk management framework;  \\n\\uf0b7  can effectively challenge activities and decisions that materially affect ANZ’s risk profile; and  \\n\\uf0b7  has an independent reporting line to the BRC to enable the appropriate escalation of issues of concern. \\nThe Internal Audit Function reports directly to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). Internal Audit provides: \\n\\uf0b7  an independent evaluation of the Group’s RMF annually that seeks to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the risk management \\nframework; \\n\\uf0b7  facilitation of a comprehensive review every three years that seeks to ensure the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the risk \\nmanagement framework; and \\n\\uf0b7  recommendations to improve the framework and/or work practices to strengthen the effectiveness of day to day operations. \\n178\\n178 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n17. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) \\nCREDIT RISK \\nCREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES \\nGranting credit facilities to customers is one of the Group’s major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Group dedicates \\nconsiderable resources to its management. The Group assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in \\nmany jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from interbank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets \\nactivities around the world. \\nOur credit risk management framework ensures we apply a consistent approach across the Group when we measure, monitor and manage the credit \\nrisk appetite set by the Board. The Board is assisted and advised by the BRC in discharging its duty to oversee credit risk. The BRC: \\n\\uf0b7  sets the credit risk appetite and credit strategies; and \\n\\uf0b7  approves credit transactions beyond the discretion of executive management. \\nWe quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent \\nframework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures: \\nProbability of Default (PD)  Expressed by a Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the Group’s assessment of a customer’s ability \\nto service and repay debt. \\nExposure at Default (EAD)  The expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and \\ninterest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest at the time of default. \\nLoss Given Default (LGD)  Expressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the \\npercentage of loan covered by security which the Group can realise if a customer defaults. The A-G \\nscale is supplemented by a range of other SIs which cover factors such as cash cover and sovereign \\nbacking. For retail and some small business lending, we group exposures into large homogenous pools \\n– and the LGD is assigned at the pool level. \\nOur specialist credit risk teams develop and validate the Group’s PD and LGD rating models. The outputs from these models drive our day-to-day \\ncredit risk management decisions including origination, pricing, approval levels, regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital allocation, and  \\ncredit provisioning. \\nAll customers with whom ANZ has a credit relationship are assigned a CCR at origination via either of the following assessment approaches: \\nLarge and more complex lending   Retail and some small business lending \\nRating models provide a consistent and structured assessment, with  Automated assessment of credit applications using a combination of \\njudgement required around the use of out-of-model factors. We  scoring (application and behavioural), policy rules and external credit \\nhandle credit approval on a dual approval basis, jointly with the  reporting information. If the application does not meet the automated \\nbusiness writer and an independent credit officer.  assessment criteria, then it is subject to manual assessment. \\nWe use the Group’s internal CCRs to manage the credit quality of financial assets. To enable wider comparisons, the Group’s CCRs are mapped to \\nexternal rating agency scales as follows: \\nCredit Quality  Moody’s  Standard & Poor’s \\nDescription  Internal CCR  ANZ Customer Requirements  Rating  Rating \\nStrong  CCR 0+ to 4-  Demonstrated superior stability in their operating and financial  Aaa – Baa3  AAA – BBB- \\nperformance over the long-term, and whose earnings capacity \\nis not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. \\nSatisfactory  CCR 5+ to 6-  Demonstrated sound operational and financial stability over  Ba1 – B1  BB+ – B+ \\nthe medium to long-term, even though some may be \\nsusceptible to cyclical trends or variability in earnings. \\nWeak  CCR 7+ to 8=  Demonstrated some operational and financial instability, with  B2 - Caa  B - CCC \\nvariability and uncertainty in profitability and liquidity \\nprojected to continue over the short and possibly medium \\nterm. \\nDefaulted  CCR 8- to 10  When doubt arises as to the collectability of a credit facility, the  N/A  N/A \\nfinancial instrument (or ‘the facility’) is classified as defaulted. \\n \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 179\\n179  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n17. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) \\nCREDIT RISK (continued) \\nMAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK  \\nFor financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain circumstances there may \\nbe differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts reported in the tables below. Principally, these \\ndifferences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to \\nmarket risk, or bank notes and coins. \\nFor undrawn facilities, this maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the committed facilities. For contingent exposures, the maximum \\nexposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon. \\nThe table below shows our maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions before taking account of any \\ncollateral held or other credit enhancements. \\nMaximum exposure \\n \\nReported   Excluded1  to credit risk \\n  2021  2020  2021  2020  2021  2020 \\nConsolidated  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m \\nOn-balance sheet positions \\nNet loans and advances  629,719  617,093  -  -  629,719  617,093 \\n \\nOther financial assets: \\nCash and cash equivalents  151,260  107,923  1,127  1,514  150,133  106,409 \\nSettlement balances owed to ANZ  7,530  7,541  7,530  7,541  -  - \\nCollateral paid  9,166  14,308  -  -  9,166  14,308 \\nTrading securities  44,688  50,913  4,996  5,698  39,692  45,215 \\nDerivative financial instruments  38,736  135,331  -  -  38,736  135,331 \\nInvestment securities \\n- debt securities at amortised cost  7,031  6,816  -  -  7,031  6,816 \\n- debt securities at FVOCI  74,743  85,460  -  -  74,743  85,460 \\n- equity securities at FVOCI  1,310  1,062  1,310  1,062  -  - \\n- debt securities at FVTPL  42  53  -  -  42  53 \\nRegulatory deposits  671  801  -  -  671  801 \\nOther financial assets2  2,054  2,407  -  -  2,054  2,407 \\nTotal other financial assets  337,231  412,615  14,963  15,815  322,268  396,800 \\nSubtotal  966,950  1,029,708  14,963  15,815  951,987  1,013,893 \\nOff-balance sheet positions \\nUndrawn and contingent facilities3  259,789  266,716  -  -  259,789  266,716 \\nTotal  1,226,739  1,296,424  14,963  15,815  1,211,776  1,280,609 \\n1.

For some products, the collateral provided by customers is \\nfundamental to the product’s structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is \\ntypically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies. \\n190\\n190 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n17.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) \\nMARKET RISK \\nMARKET RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES \\nMarket risk stems from the Group’s trading and balance sheet management activities and the impact of changes and correlations between interest \\nrates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and volatility in bond, commodity or equity prices. \\nThe BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit & Market Risk \\nCommittee (CMRC) and the Group Asset & Liability Committee (GALCO). \\nWithin overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market \\nrisk at the Group level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various \\nlevels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors \\nand profit and loss limits. \\nManagement, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories: \\nTraded Market Risk  Non-Traded Market Risk \\nRisk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due  Risk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, \\nto movements in price factors for both physical and derivative  liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk \\ntrading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are:  in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the \\n1. Currency risk – potential loss arising from changes in foreign  overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in \\nexchange rates or their implied volatilities.  the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation \\nrisk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank \\n2. Interest rate risk – potential loss from changes in market interest \\nproducts. \\nrates or their implied volatilities. \\n3. Credit spread risk – potential loss arising from a movement in \\nmargin or spread relative to a benchmark. \\n4. Commodity risk – potential loss arising from changes in \\ncommodity prices or their implied volatilities. \\n5. Equity risk – potential loss arising from changes in equity prices. \\n  \\nMEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK \\nWe primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing. \\nVaR measures the Group’s possible daily loss based on historical market movements. \\nThe Group’s VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and     \\nvolatilities over: \\n\\uf0b7  the previous 500 business days, to calculate standard VaR; and  \\n\\uf0b7  a 1-year stressed period, to calculate stressed VaR. \\nWe calculate traded and non-traded VaR using one-day and ten-day holding periods. For stressed VaR, we use a ten-day period. Back testing is used to \\nensure our VaR models remain accurate. \\nANZ measures VaR at a 99% confidence interval which means there is a 99% chance that a loss will not exceed the VaR for the relevant holding period. \\n192\\n192 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n17.

Variations in the value of these foreign operations arising as a result of \\nexchange differences are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. \\nWhere it is considered appropriate, the Group takes out economic hedges against larger foreign exchange denominated revenue streams (primarily \\nNew Zealand Dollar, US Dollar and US Dollar correlated). The primary objective of hedging is to ensure that, if practical, the effect of changes in foreign \\nexchange rates on the consolidated capital ratios are minimised.  \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 195\\n195  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n17. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)  \\nLIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK \\nLIQUIDITY RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES \\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group is either: \\n\\uf0b7  unable to meet its payment obligations (including repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt) when they fall due; or  \\n\\uf0b7  does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to fund increases in its assets. \\nManagement of liquidity and funding risks are overseen by GALCO. The Group’s liquidity and funding risks are governed by a set of principles \\napproved by the BRC and include: \\n\\uf0b7  maintaining the ability to meet all payment obligations in the immediate term; \\n\\uf0b7  ensuring that the Group has the ability to meet ‘survival horizons’ under a range of ANZ specific, and general market, liquidity stress scenarios, at \\nthe site and Group-wide level, to meet cash flow obligations over the short to medium term; \\n\\uf0b7  maintaining strength in the Group’s balance sheet structure to ensure long term resilience in the liquidity and funding risk profile; \\n\\uf0b7  ensuring the liquidity management framework is compatible with local regulatory requirements; \\n\\uf0b7  preparing daily liquidity reports and scenario analysis to quantify the Group’s positions; \\n\\uf0b7  targeting a diversified funding base to avoid undue concentrations by investor type, maturity, market source and currency; \\n\\uf0b7  holding a portfolio of high quality liquid assets to protect against adverse funding conditions and to support day-to-day operations; and \\n\\uf0b7  establishing detailed contingency plans to cover different liquidity crisis events. \\nKEY AREAS OF MEASUREMENT FOR LIQUIDITY RISK \\nScenario modelling of funding sources \\nANZ’s liquidity risk appetite is defined by a range of regulatory and internal liquidity metrics mandated by the Board. The metrics cover a range of \\nscenarios of varying duration and level of severity. \\nA key component of this framework is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is a severe short term liquidity stress scenario mandated by banking \\nregulators including APRA. As part of meeting LCR requirements, the Group has a Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) with the Reserve Bank of Australia \\n(RBA). The CLF was established to offset the shortage of available High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in Australia and provides an alternative form of \\ncontingent liquidity. The CLF is collateralised by assets, including internal residential mortgage backed securities, that are eligible to be pledged as \\nsecurity with the RBA. The total amount of the CLF available to a qualifying Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) is set annually by APRA. The \\ntotal amount of the CLF available to a qualifying Australian Deposit-taking Institution is set annually by APRA. In September 2021, APRA wrote to ADI’s \\nto advise that APRA and the RBA consider there to be sufficient HQLA for ADI’s to meet their LCR requirements, and therefore the use of the CLF \\nshould no longer be required beyond 2022. \\nFrom 1 January 2021, ANZ’s CLF is $10.7 billion (2020 calendar year end: $35.7 billion). Consistent with APRA’s requirement, ANZ’s CLF will decrease to \\nzero through equal reductions on 1 January, 30 April, 31 August and 31 December 2022. This reduction will be managed as part of ANZ’s funding \\nplans over this period. \\nLiquid assets \\nThe Group holds a portfolio of high quality (unencumbered) liquid assets to protect the Group’s liquidity position in a severely stressed environment \\nand to meet regulatory requirements. HQLA comprise three categories consistent with Basel III LCR requirements: \\n\\uf0b7  HQLA1- Cash and highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide \\nsame-day liquidity. \\n\\uf0b7  HQLA2 - High credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities and high quality covered \\nbonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity. \\n\\uf0b7  Alternative liquid assets (ALA) - Assets qualifying as collateral for the CLF and eligible securities that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will \\naccept in its domestic market operations. \\nLIQUIDITY RISK OUTCOMES1 \\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio \\nANZ’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) averaged 136% for 2021, a decrease from the 2020 average of 139%, and above the regulatory minimum of \\n100%. \\nNet Stable Funding Ratio \\nANZ’s Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as at 30 September 2021 was 124% (2020: 124%), above the regulatory minimum of 100%. \\n \\n1.

The TFF is a three-year secured funding facility to ADIs at a fixed rate of 0.25%. APRA has determined that the TFF qualifies for \\ninclusion in determining the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). ADIs can obtain initial funding of up to 3% of their \\nexisting credit outstanding to Australian households and businesses, and have access to additional funding if they increase lending to business, \\nespecially to small and medium-sized businesses. The TFF closed to drawdowns on 30 June 2021. \\nAs at 30 September 2021, ANZ had drawn $20.1 billion under the RBA’s TFF. \\nRBNZ Funding for Lending Programme and Term Lending Facility \\n\\uf0b7  Between May 2020 and July 2021, the RBNZ made funds available under a term lending facility (TLF) to promote lending to businesses. The TLF is a \\nthree to five-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a fixed rate of 0.25%.  \\n\\uf0b7  In November 2020, the RBNZ announced a funding for lending programme (FLP) which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand \\nbusinesses and households. The FLP is a three-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a floating rate of the New Zealand Official \\nCash Rate (OCR). New Zealand banks can obtain initial funding of up to 4% of their lending to New Zealand resident households, non-financial \\nbusinesses and non-profit institutions serving households as at 31 October 2020 (eligible loans). An additional allocation of up to 2% of eligible \\nloans is available, subject to certain conditions. The additional allocation is available until 6 December 2022, and the initial allocation is available \\nuntil 6 June 2022. \\nAs at 30 September 2021, ANZ NZ had drawn $0.3 billion under the TLF and $0.9 billion under the FLP. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\xa0  \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 197\\n197  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n17.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES \\nThe Group carries a significant number of financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value is the best estimate of the price \\nthat would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement \\ndate. \\nVALUATION \\nThe Group has an established control framework, including appropriate segregation of duties, to ensure that fair values are accurately determined, \\nreported and controlled. The framework includes the following features: \\n\\uf0b7  products are approved for transacting with external customers and counterparties only where fair values can be appropriately determined; \\n\\uf0b7  quoted market prices used to value financial instruments are independently verified with information from external pricing providers; \\n\\uf0b7  fair value methodologies and inputs are evaluated and approved by a function independent of the party that undertakes the transaction; \\n\\uf0b7  movements in fair values are independently monitored and explained by reference to underlying factors relevant to the fair value; and \\n\\uf0b7  valuation adjustments (such as funding valuation adjustments, credit valuation adjustments and bid-offer adjustments) are independently \\nvalidated and monitored. \\nIf the Group holds offsetting risk positions, then the Group uses the portfolio exception in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) to measure the \\nfair value of such groups of financial assets and financial liabilities. We measure the portfolio based on the price that would be received to sell a net \\nlong position (an asset) for a particular risk exposure, or to transfer a net short position (a liability) for a particular risk exposure. \\nFair value designation \\nWe designate certain loans and advances and certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss: \\n\\uf0b7  where they contain a separable embedded derivative which significantly modifies the instruments’ cash flow; or \\n\\uf0b7  in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch which would arise if the asset or liabilities were otherwise carried at amortised cost. This mismatch \\narises due to measuring the derivative financial instruments (which we acquired to mitigate interest rate risk of these assets or liabilities) at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss. \\nOur approach ensures that we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on \\nthe associated derivatives. \\nWe may also designate certain loans and advances, certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss \\nwhere they are managed on a fair value basis to align the measurement with how the instruments are managed. \\nFAIR VALUE APPROACH AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES \\nWe use valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities for recognition, measurement and disclosure purposes where no quoted \\nprice in an active market exists for that asset or liability. This includes the following: \\n \\nAsset or Liability  Fair Value Approach \\nFinancial instruments classified as:  Valuation techniques are used that incorporate observable market inputs for financial \\nTrading securities  instruments with similar credit risk, maturity and yield characteristics.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued) \\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT INCORPORATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET DATA \\nLevel 3 fair value measurements \\nThe net balance of Level 3 financial instruments is an asset of $1,467 million (2020: $1,128 million) for the Group and $1,160 million (2020: $1,003 \\nmillion) for the Company.  \\nThe assets and liabilities which incorporate significant unobservable inputs primarily include: \\n\\uf0b7  equities for which there is no active market or traded prices cannot be observed; \\n\\uf0b7  net loans and advances that are required to be measured at fair value for which there is no observable market data; and \\n\\uf0b7  derivatives referencing market rates that cannot be observed primarily due to lack of market activity. \\nThe increase in the net balance of Level 3 financial instruments is Investment Securities, due to the revaluation of the investment in Bank of Tianjin \\n(Group and Company), and an increase in unlisted equity investments (Group).  \\nDuring the year, the Group and Company transferred $5 million of derivative liabilities from Level 3 to Level 2, where valuation parameters for these \\nfinancial instruments became observable during the year, and $105 million of Loan and advances measured at fair value from Level 2 to Level 3, where \\nvaluation parameters for these loans became unobservable during the year. There were no other transfers in or out of Level 3 in the current or prior \\nyear. \\nBank of Tianjin (BoT) \\nThe investment is valued based on comparator bank price-to-book (P/B) multiples (a P/B multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book \\nvalue of equity). The extent of judgement applied in determining the appropriate multiple and comparator group from which the multiple is derived \\nare non-observable inputs which have resulted in the Level 3 classification.  \\nSensitivity to Level 3 data inputs \\nWhen we make assumptions due to significant inputs not being directly observable in the market place (Level 3 inputs), then changing these \\nassumptions changes the Group’s estimate of the instrument’s fair value. Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined by changing the \\nprimary unobservable parameter used to derive the valuation. \\nBank of Tianjin (BoT) \\nThe valuation of the BoT investment is sensitive to the selected unobservable input, being the P/B multiple. If the P/B multiple was increased or \\ndecreased by 10% it would result in a $99 million (2020: $93 million) increase or decrease to the fair value of the investment, which would be \\nrecognised in shareholders’ equity. \\nOther \\nThe remaining Level 3 balance is immaterial and changes in inputs have a minimal impact on net profit and net assets of the Group. \\nDeferred fair value gains and losses \\nWhere fair values are determined using unobservable inputs significant to the fair value of a financial instrument, the Group does not immediately \\nrecognise the difference between the transaction price and the amount we determine based on the valuation technique (day one gain or loss) in \\nprofit or loss. After initial recognition, we recognise the deferred amount in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the life of the transaction or until \\nall inputs become observable. \\nDay one gains and losses which have been deferred are not material. \\n204\\n204 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n18.

We do not adjust the fair \\nvalue for any value we expect the Group to derive from retaining the deposit for a \\nfuture period. \\nInterest bearing fixed maturity deposits and other  Market borrowing rates of interest for debt with a similar maturity are used to \\nborrowings and acceptances with quoted market rates  discount contractual cash flows to derive the fair value. \\nDebt issuances  Calculated based on quoted market prices or observable inputs as applicable.

This has not changed as a result of COVID-\\n19, however the Group has considered the impact of related economic and market disruptions on fair value measurement assumptions \\nand the appropriateness of valuation inputs, notably valuation adjustments, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on the classification of \\nexposures in the fair value hierarchy. \\nFor certain financial instruments, we may use data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, \\nthen we need to exercise more judgement to determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall \\nvaluation. Generally, we derive unobservable inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices \\nwhere available.  \\nWhen establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers valuation adjustments in \\ndetermining the fair value. We may apply adjustments (such as bid/offer spreads, credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation \\nadjustments – refer Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments) to reflect the Group’s assessment of factors that market participants would \\nconsider in determining fair value. \\n206\\n206 19.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at the date of acquisition to the cash \\ngenerating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related business combination. These CGUs are ANZ’s reportable \\nsegments. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. \\nWe estimate the recoverable amount of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated using a fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) approach, with a \\nvalue-in-use (VIU) assessment performed where the FVLCOD is less than the carrying amount. \\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2021, $251 million of goodwill was written off upon reclassification of ANZ Share Investing to held for sale in the \\nGroup (Company: nil) with a remaining $13 million of goodwill derecognised upon completion of the disposal.   \\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2020, the Group wrote off $124 million of goodwill in relation to completed divestments (Company: $10 million).  \\nIn addition, the Group announced its intention to begin winding up the Bonus Bonds business, a managed investment product in New Zealand and \\nthe Group wrote off the associated goodwill of $27 million (Company: nil). The Group wrote off $50 million of goodwill in the Pacific division \\n(Company: $10 million) as a result of changes in economic outlook. \\n210\\n210 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n21. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued) \\nFair Value Less Cost of Disposal \\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated is estimated on a FVLCOD basis, calculated using a market multiple approach. \\nUnder this approach, we determine the estimated fair value of each CGU by applying observable price earnings multiples of appropriate comparator \\ncompanies to the estimated future maintainable earnings of each CGU. A deduction is then made for estimated costs of disposal. The valuation is \\nconsidered to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to unobservable inputs used in the valuation. \\nManagement’s approach and the key assumptions used to determine FVLCOD, for those CGUs where recoverable amount was determined on the \\nbasis of FVLCOD were as follows: \\nKey assumption  Approach to determining the value (or values) for each key assumption \\nFuture maintainable earnings  Future maintainable earnings for each CGU have been estimated as the sum of: \\n\\uf0b7  The Group’s 2022 financial plan for each CGU; plus \\n\\uf0b7  An allocation of the central costs recorded outside of the CGU’s to which goodwill is allocated. \\nWhere relevant, adjustments are made to the Group’s financial plan to reflect the long term expectations for \\nitems such as expected credit losses and investment spend. \\nPrice/Earnings (P/E) multiple  The P/E multiples used have been derived from valuations of comparable publicly traded companies \\napplied  relevant to the respective CGU. \\nIn the case of the New Zealand and Institutional CGUs, management has made downwards adjustments to \\ncomparator group multiples to address specific factors relevant to those CGUs. \\nThe median P/E multiples applied (including a 30% control premium discussed below) were as follows: \\nDivision    2021  2020 \\nAustralia Retail and Commercial    18.9  16.0 \\nNew Zealand    16.4  12.7 \\nInstitutional    15.5  13.4 \\nControl premium: \\nA control premium has been applied which recognises the increased consideration a potential acquirer \\nwould be willing to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to achieve control over the relevant activities of \\nthe CGU. For each CGU, the control premium has been estimated as 30% of the comparator group P/E \\nmultiple based on historical transactions. \\nCosts of disposal\\xa0 Costs of disposal have been estimated as 2% of the fair value of the CGU based on input from historical and \\nrecent transactions. \\n \\nAs noted above, our impairment testing did not result in any material impairment of goodwill being identified as at 30 September 2021. \\nFVLCOD assessment outcomes \\nFor each CGU, the surplus of the recoverable amount over the carrying amount determined on the basis of FVLCOD was as follows: \\n\\xa0       Surplus \\n2021 \\nCash generating unit:        $m \\nAustralia Retail and Commercial         12,168 \\nNew Zealand        6,332 \\nInstitutional        4,249 \\nSensitivity analysis  \\nThe surpluses disclosed above are sensitive to judgements and estimates however the FVLCOD estimates for the respective CGUs would continue to \\nshow a surplus in recoverable amount over carrying amount even where reasonably possible alternative estimates were used. \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 211\\n211  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n21.

In the event that an asset’s carrying amount is determined to be greater than its \\nrecoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset is written down immediately. Those assets not yet ready for use are tested for \\nimpairment annually. \\nIn addition, the expected useful lives of intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date.

Costs relating to on-going activities are not provided for and are \\nexpensed as incurred.  \\nNon-lending losses, frauds and forgeries \\nNon-lending losses include losses arising from certain legal actions not directly related to amounts of principal outstanding for loans and advances \\nand losses arising from forgeries, frauds and the correction of operational issues. The amounts recognised are the best estimate of the consideration \\nrequired to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties that surround the events and \\ncircumstances that affect the provision. \\nOther \\nOther provisions comprise various other provisions including workers compensation, make-good provisions associated with leased premises, \\nwarranties and indemnities provided in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets, and contingent liabilities recognised as part of a \\nbusiness combination.  \\n \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT \\nThe Group recognises provisions when there is a present obligation arising from a past event, an outflow of economic resources is \\nprobable, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably. \\nThe amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into \\naccount the risks and uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the \\nestimated cash flows required to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.\\xa0\\n \\n \\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES \\nThe Group holds provisions for various obligations including customer remediation, restructuring costs, non-lending losses, fraud and \\nforgeries and litigation related claims. These provisions involve judgements regarding the timing and outcome of future events, including \\nestimates of expenditure required to satisfy such obligations. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in light of such \\nadvice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. \\nIn relation to customer remediation, determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management’s best estimate of the cost \\nof settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement.

As debt securities at FVOCI \\nare recorded at fair value, the balance of the FVOCI reserve is net of the ECL allowance \\nassociated with such assets. When a debt security measured at FVOCI is derecognised, the \\ncumulative gain or loss recognised in the FVOCI reserve in respect of that security is \\nreclassified to profit or loss and presented in Other operating income. \\nIn respect of the equity securities classified as measured at FVOCI, the FVOCI reserve records \\naccumulated changes in fair value arising subsequent to initial recognition (including any \\nrelated foreign exchange gains or losses).

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY \\nANZ’s capital management strategy aims to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. We achieve this through an Internal      \\nCapital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon.  \\nThe process involves: \\n\\uf0b7  forecasting economic variables, financial performance of ANZ’s divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented \\nduring the planning period; \\n\\uf0b7  performing stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital (‘stress capital buffer’) needed to absorb \\nlosses that may be experienced under an economic downturn; \\n\\uf0b7  reviewing capital ratios and targets across various classes of capital against ANZ’s risk profile; and \\n\\uf0b7  developing a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, current and future capital issuances requirements and options around capital \\nproducts, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions. \\nThe capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of ANZ’s \\ncapital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout \\nthe year, the Group maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates. \\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT \\nAustralia \\nAs ANZ is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is primarily regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). ANZ must \\ncomply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that APRA sets and which are \\nconsistent with the global Basel III capital framework. This is the common framework for determining the appropriate level of bank regulatory capital \\nas set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (‘BCBS’). APRA requirements are summarised below: \\nRegulatory Capital Definition \\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital  Tier 1 Capital  Tier 2 Capital  Total Capital \\nShareholders’ equity adjusted for  CET1 Capital plus certain  Subordinated debt instruments  Tier 1 plus Tier 2 Capital. \\nspecific items.  securities with complying loss  which have a minimum term of 5 \\nabsorbing characteristics known  years at issue date. \\nas Additional Tier 1 Capital. \\nMinimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs) \\nCET1 Ratio  Tier 1 Ratio  Total Capital Ratio \\nCET1 Capital divided by total risk  Tier 1 Capital divided by total risk  Total Capital divided by total risk weighted \\nweighted assets must be at least 4.5%.  weighted assets must be at least  assets must be at least 8.0%. \\n6.0%. \\nReporting Levels \\nLevel 1  Level 2  Level 3 \\nThe ADI on a stand-alone basis (that is  The consolidated Group less  A conglomerate Group at the widest level.  \\nthe Company and specified subsidiaries  certain subsidiaries and associates \\nwhich are consolidated to form the  that are excluded under \\nADI’s Extended Licensed Entity).  prudential standards. \\nAPRA also requires the ADI to hold additional CET1 buffers as follows: \\n\\uf0b7  a capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 3.5% which is inclusive of the additional 1% surcharge for domestically systemically important banks (D-SIBs). \\nAPRA has determined that ANZ is a D-SIB. \\n\\uf0b7  a countercyclical capital buffer which is set on a jurisdictional basis. The requirement is currently set to zero for Australia. \\nANZ reports to APRA on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and measures capital adequacy monthly on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and is not yet required to \\nmaintain capital on a Level 3 basis (APRA have yet to conclude required timing for Level 3 reporting). \\n218\\n218 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n24. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  (continued)    \\nLife Insurance and Funds Management \\nAs required by APRA’s Prudential Standards, insurance and funds management activities are: \\n\\uf0b7  de-consolidated for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy; and \\n\\uf0b7  excluded from the risk based capital adequacy framework. \\nWe deduct the investment in these controlled entities 100% from CET1 capital, and if we include any profits from these activities in the Group’s results, \\nthen we exclude them from the determination of CET1 capital to the extent they have not been remitted to the Company. \\nOutside Australia   \\nIn addition to APRA, the Company’s branch operations and major banking subsidiary operations are also overseen by local regulators such as the \\nReserve Bank of New Zealand, the US Federal Reserve, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong \\nMonetary Authority and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued) \\nIMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT \\nThe Group assesses the carrying value of its associate investments for impairment indicators.  \\nAt 30 September 2021, the impairment assessment of non-lending assets identified that two of the Group’s associate investments AmBank and \\nPT Panin had indicators of impairment. No impairment was recognised as their carrying values are supported by their value-in-use (VIU) \\ncalculations. \\n  \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT \\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence over its operating and financial policies but does not control. The \\nGroup accounts for associates using the equity method. Its investments in associates are carried at cost plus the post-acquisition share of \\nchanges in the associate’s net assets less accumulated impairments. Dividends the Group receives from associates are recognised as a \\nreduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The Group includes goodwill recognised by the associate in the carrying amount of \\nthe investment. It does not individually test the goodwill incorporated in the associates carrying amount for impairment. \\nAt least at each reporting date, the Group reviews investments in associates for any indication of impairment. If an indication of impairment \\nexists, then the Group determines the recoverable amount of the associate using the higher of: \\n\\uf0b7  the associate’s fair value less cost of disposal; and \\n\\uf0b7  its value-in-use.  \\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology, and when applicable, other methodologies (such as capitalisation of earnings methodology), \\nto determine the recoverable amount. \\n \\n \\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES \\nThe ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of AmBank and PT Panin remains uncertain. Significant management judgment is \\nrequired in determining the key assumptions underpinning the VIU calculations. Factors may change in subsequent periods and lead to \\npotential future impairments or reversals of prior period impairments. These include forecast earnings levels in the near term and/or \\nchanges in the long term growth forecasts, required levels of regulatory capital and post-tax discount rate. \\nThe key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are outlined below: \\nAs at 30 September 2021  AmBank  PT Panin \\n \\nPost-tax discount rate  10.6%  14.4% \\n \\nTerminal growth rate  5.0%  5.1% \\n \\nExpected earnings growth (compound annual growth rate – 5 years)  4.2%  6.4% \\n \\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio (5 year average)  13.4%  12.8% \\n \\n \\nThe VIU calculations are sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions with reasonably possible changes in key assumptions having a \\npositive or negative impact on the VIU outcome, and as such the recoverable amount of the investment.  \\n\\uf0b7  A change in the September 2021 post-tax discount rate by +/- 50 bps would impact the VIU outcome for PT Panin by ($55 million)/ \\n$60 million, and ($84 million)/$106 million for AmBank.  \\n\\uf0b7  A change in the September 2021 terminal growth rate by +/- 25 bps would impact the VIU outcome for PT Panin by $9 million/ \\n($10 million), and $49 million/($45 million) for AmBank.  \\nNeither investment would be impaired if the discount rate were increased or the terminal growth rate reduced by the reasonably possible \\nchanges above. \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 223\\n223 27.

STRUCTURED ENTITIES \\nA Structured Entity (SE) is an entity that has been designed such that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining who controls \\nthe entity. SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well defined objectives. \\nSEs are classified as subsidiaries and consolidated when control exists. If the Group does not control a SE, then it is not consolidated. This note \\nprovides information on both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs. \\nThe Group’s involvement with SEs is as follows: \\nType  Details \\nSecuritisation  The Group establishes SEs to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated, in order to diversify \\nsources of funding for liquidity management. Securitisation programs include customer loans and advances \\nassigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide either security for obligations payable on notes issued by the SEs \\nto external investors or create assets held by the Group eligible for repurchase agreements with applicable \\ncentral banks. \\nThe Group retains control over these SEs and therefore they are consolidated. Refer to Note 28 Transfers of \\nFinancial Assets for further details. \\nThe Group also establishes SEs on behalf of customers to securitise their loans or receivables. The Group may \\nmanage these securitisation vehicles or provide liquidity or other support. Additionally, the Group may acquire \\ninterests in securitisation vehicles set up by third parties through holding securities issued by such entities. In \\nlimited circumstances where control exists, the Group consolidates the SE. \\nCovered bond issuances  Certain loans and advances have been assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for issuances of \\ndebt securities by the Group. The Group retains control over these SEs and therefore they are consolidated. Refer \\nto Note 28 Transfers of Financial Assets for further details. \\nStructured finance  The Group is involved with SEs established: \\narrangements  \\uf0b7  in connection with structured lending transactions to facilitate debt syndication and/or to ring-fence \\ncollateral; and \\n\\uf0b7  to own assets that are leased to customers in structured leasing transactions. \\nThe Group may manage the SE, hold minor amounts of the SE’s capital, or provide risk management products \\n(derivatives) to the SE. In most instances, the Group does not control these SEs. In limited circumstances where \\ncontrol exists, the Group consolidates the SE. \\nFunds management activities  The Group is the scheme manager for a number of Managed Investment Schemes (MIS) in New Zealand. These \\nMIS are financed through the issue of units to investors and the Group considers them to be SEs. The Group’s \\ninterests in these MIS are limited to receiving fees for services or providing risk management products \\n(derivatives). These interests do not create significant exposures that would allow the Group to control the funds. \\nTherefore, these MIS are not consolidated. \\nCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES \\nFINANCIAL OR OTHER SUPPORT PROVIDED TO CONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES \\nThe Group provides financial support to consolidated SEs as outlined below.  \\nSecuritisation and covered  The Group provides lending facilities, derivatives and commitments to these SEs and/or holds debt instruments \\nbond issuances  that they have issued.  \\nStructured finance  The assets held by these SEs are normally pledged as collateral for financing provided. Certain consolidated SEs \\narrangements  are financed entirely by the Group while others are financed by syndicated loan facilities in which the Group is a \\nparticipant. The financing provided by the Group includes lending facilities where the Group’s exposure is limited \\nto the amount of the loan and any undrawn amount. Additionally, the Group has provided Letters of Support to \\nthese consolidated SEs confirming that the Group will not demand repayment of the financing provided for the \\nensuing 12 month period. \\nThe Group did not provide any non-contractual support to consolidated SEs during the year (2020: nil). Other than as disclosed above, the Group does \\nnot have any current intention to provide financial or other support to consolidated SEs.   \\n224\\n224 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n27. STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued) \\nUNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES \\nGROUP’S INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES \\nAn ‘interest’ in an unconsolidated SE is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement with a SE that exposes the Group to variability of \\nreturns from the performance of that SE. These interests include, but are not limited to: holdings of debt or equity securities; derivatives that pass-on \\nrisks specific to the performance of the SE; lending; loan commitments; financial guarantees; and fees from funds management activities. \\nFor the purpose of disclosing interests in unconsolidated SEs: \\n\\uf0b7  no disclosure is made if the Group’s involvement is not more than a passive interest - for example: when the Group’s involvement constitutes a \\ntypical customer-supplier relationship. On this basis, exposures to unconsolidated SEs that arise from lending, trading and investing activities are \\nnot considered disclosable interests - unless the design of the structured entity allows the Group to participate in decisions about the relevant \\nactivities (being those that significantly affect the entity’s returns). \\n\\uf0b7  ‘interests’ do not include derivatives intended to expose the Group to market-risk (rather than performance risk specific to the SE) or derivatives \\nthrough which the Group creates, rather than absorbs, variability of the unconsolidated SE (such as purchase of credit protection under a credit \\ndefault swap). \\nThe table below sets out the Group’s interests in unconsolidated SEs together with the maximum exposure to loss that could arise from \\nthose interests: \\n  Securitisation                  Structured finance  Total \\n  2021  2020  2021  2020  2021  2020 \\n  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m \\nOn-balance sheet interests \\nInvestment securities  2,624  2,280  -  -  2,624  2,280 \\nGross loans and advances  7,697  8,479  53  74  7,750  8,553 \\nTotal on-balance sheet  10,321  10,759  53  74  10,374  10,833 \\nOff-balance sheet interests \\nCommitments (facilities undrawn)   2,034  2,072  -  22  2,034  2,094 \\nGuarantees  50  40  -  -  50  40 \\nTotal off-balance sheet  2,084  2,112  -  22  2,084  2,134 \\nMaximum exposure to loss  12,405  12,871  53  96  12,458  12,967 \\nIn addition to the interests above, the Group earned funds management fees from unconsolidated investment funds of $192 million (2020: $285 \\nmillion) during the year. \\nThe Group’s maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum amount of loss that the Group could incur as a result of its involvement with \\nunconsolidated SEs if loss events were to take place - regardless of the probability of occurrence. This does not in any way represent the actual losses \\nexpected to be incurred. Furthermore, the maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered \\ninto to mitigate ANZ’s exposure to loss. \\nThe maximum exposure to loss has been determined as: \\n\\uf0b7  the carrying amount of Investment securities measured at amortised cost; and \\n\\uf0b7  the carrying amount plus the undrawn amount of any committed loans and advances. \\nThe size of unconsolidated SEs is indicated by total assets which vary by SE with a maximum value of approximately $4.3 billion. \\nThe Group did not provide any non-contractual support to unconsolidated SEs during the year (2020: nil) nor does it have any current intention to \\nprovide financial or other support to unconsolidated SEs. \\n   \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 225\\n225  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n27. STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued) \\nSPONSORED UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES \\nThe Group may also sponsor unconsolidated SEs in which it has no disclosable interest. \\nFor the purposes of this disclosure, the Group considers itself the ‘sponsor’ of an unconsolidated SE if it is the primary party involved in the design and \\nestablishment of that SE and: \\n\\uf0b7  the Group is the major user of that SE; or \\n\\uf0b7  the Group’s name appears in the name of that SE, or on its products; or \\n\\uf0b7  the Group provides implicit or explicit guarantees of that SE’s performance. \\nThe Group has sponsored the ANZ PIE Fund in New Zealand, which invests only in deposits with ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited. The Group does not \\nprovide any implicit or explicit guarantees of the capital value or performance of investments in the ANZ PIE Fund. There was no income received \\nfrom, nor assets transferred to, this entity during the year. \\n \\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES \\nSignificant judgement is required in assessing whether the Group has control over Structured Entities. Judgement is required to determine \\nthe existence of: \\n\\uf0b7  power over the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity’s returns); \\n\\uf0b7  exposure to variable returns of the entity; and \\n\\uf0b7  the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the Group’s returns.  \\n \\n\\xa0\\n28. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS \\nIn the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to SEs. These transfers \\nmay give rise to the Group fully, or partially, derecognising those financial assets - depending on the Group’s exposure to the risks and rewards or \\ncontrol over the transferred assets. If the Group retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for \\nderecognition and the asset remains on the Group’s balance sheet in its entirety. \\nSECURITISATIONS  \\nNet loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Group’s securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy \\nremote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of \\nresidential mortgages which have been securitised and the Group cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets. \\nIn some instances, the Group is also the holder of the securitised notes issued by the SEs. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of \\nthe SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to \\nrecognise the mortgages as financial assets. \\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its \\npower over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. \\nDuring the 2021 financial year, the Company changed its accounting policy regarding intragroup positions with consolidated securitisation SEs in \\nwhich it holds all of the issued securities of the SE. The Company records a net nil position with the securitisation SE to reflect the economic substance \\nof these fully offsetting intercompany transactions. Refer to Note 35 Impacts of Adoption of New Standards and Other Changes for further details of \\nthe change in accounting policy.    \\n226\\n226 28.

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS (continued) \\nCOVERED BONDS  \\nThe Group operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential \\nmortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. The mortgages provide security for the obligations \\npayable on the issued covered bonds. \\nThe covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the \\ntransferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained. \\nThe Group is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual \\nincome of the covered bond SEs and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential \\nmortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SEs is recognised as a financial \\nliability of the Group. \\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power \\nover the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances. \\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS \\nWhen the Group sells securities subject to repurchase agreements under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, then \\nthose assets do not qualify for derecognition. An associated liability is recognised for the consideration received from the counterparty. \\nSTRUCTURED FINANCE ARRANGEMENTS \\nThe Group arranges funding for certain customer transactions through structured leasing and commodity prepayment arrangements. These \\ntransactions are recognised on Group’s balance sheet as lease receivables or loans. At times, other financial institutions participate in the funding of \\nthese arrangements. This participation involves a proportionate transfer of the rights to the assets recognised by the Group. The participating banks \\nhave limited recourse to the leased assets or financed commodity and related proceeds. Where the Group continues to be exposed to some of the \\nrisks of the transferred assets through a derivative or other continuing involvement, the Group does not derecognise the lease receivable or loan. \\nInstead, the Group recognises an associated liability representing its obligations to the participating financial institutions. \\nThe tables below set out the balance of assets transferred that do not qualify for derecognition, along with the associated liabilities. \\n \\nRepurchase  Structured finance \\nSecuritisations1,2  Covered bonds  agreements  arrangements \\n  2021  2020  2021  2020  2021  2020  2021  2020 \\nConsolidated  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m \\nCurrent carrying amount of assets transferred  1,430  1,831  28,816  28,559  51,208  61,415  55  67 \\nCarrying amount of associated liabilities  1,424  1,824  15,399  15,948  46,147  55,716  55  67 \\n \\nRepurchase  Structured finance \\n  Securitisations1,2  Covered bonds  agreements  arrangements \\n  2021  2020  2021  2020  2021  2020  2021  2020 \\nThe Company  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m  $m \\nCurrent carrying amount of assets transferred  1,430  1,831  17,925  17,937  48,663  60,612  -  - \\nCarrying amount of associated liabilities  1,430  1,831  17,925  17,937  43,925  54,951  -  - \\n1.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE  \\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS \\nThe Group completed the sale of its Aligned Dealer Groups business to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF) on 1 October 2018, its life insurance business to \\nZurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) on 31 May 2019 and its OnePath pensions and investments business to IOOF on 31 January 2020. \\nThe financial results of these divested businesses are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective. The financial results \\nafter transaction completion primarily relate to residual operational costs on separation and part recovery based on the respective Transition Service \\nAgreements. The loss after tax from discontinued operations for the year was $17 million (2020: $98 million loss). \\nINCOME STATEMENT IMPACT RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD \\nFOR SALE \\nDuring the 2021 financial year, the Group recognised the following impacts in relation to discontinued operations: \\n\\uf0b7  $17 million loss after tax attributable to customer remediation charges of $3 million and an associated $1 million tax benefit, and ongoing sale \\ncompletion costs net of recoveries. \\nDuring the 2020 financial year, the Group recognised the following impacts in relation to discontinued operations: \\n\\uf0b7  $13 million loss after tax recorded in operating income attributable to sale completion costs. \\n\\uf0b7  $126 million of customer remediation charges and an associated $30 million tax benefit. \\n\\uf0b7  $101 million charge recognised in operating income offset by a $101 million tax benefit within income tax expense relating to the finalisation of \\nthe policyholder tax position associated with the sale of the life insurance business to Zurich. \\n \\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES \\n A significant level of judgement is used by the Group to determine: \\n\\uf0b7  whether an asset or group of assets is classified and presented as held for sale or as a discontinued operation; and  \\n\\uf0b7  the fair value of the assets and liabilities classified as being held for sale. \\nManagement is required to exercise significant judgement when assessing the fair value less costs to sell for assets and liabilities held for \\nsale. The judgemental factors include determining: costs to sell, allocation of goodwill, indemnities provided under the sale contract and \\nconsideration received - particularly where elements of consideration are contingent in nature. Any impairment we record is based on the \\nbest available evidence of fair value compared to the carrying value before the impairment. The final sale price may be different to the fair \\nvalue we estimate when recording the impairment. Management regularly assess the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions \\nagainst actual outcomes and other relevant evidence and adjustments are made to fair value where appropriate. We expect that sales will \\ncomplete within 12 months after balance date, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals and customary terms of sale for such assets. \\n228\\n228 30.

In 2021, the Group made defined benefit contributions totaling $3 million (2020: $4 \\nmillion). It expects to make contributions of around $2 million next financial year. \\nGOVERNANCE OF THE SCHEMES AND FUNDING OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT SECTIONS \\nThe main defined benefit superannuation schemes in which the Group participates operate under trust law and are managed and administered on \\nbehalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the relevant trust deed and rules and all relevant legislation. These schemes have corporate \\ntrustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets \\nof the Group, and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial \\nvaluation process. \\nThe Group has defined benefit arrangements in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan and United Kingdom. The defined benefit section \\nof the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme, the ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme and the ANZ National Retirement Scheme in New Zealand are \\nthe three largest plans. They have been closed to new members since 1987, 2004 and 1991 respectively. None of the schemes had a material deficit, \\nor surplus, at the last funding valuation. The Group has no present liability under any of the schemes’ trust deeds to fund a deficit (measured on a \\nfunding basis). A contingent liability of the Group may arise if any of the schemes were wound up. \\n \\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT \\nDefined benefit superannuation schemes \\nThe Group operates a small number of defined benefit schemes. Independent actuaries calculate the liability and expenses related to \\nproviding benefits to employees under each defined benefit scheme. They use the Projected Unit Credit Method to value the liabilities. The \\nbalance sheet includes: \\n\\uf0b7  a defined benefit liability if the obligation is greater than the fair value of the schemes assets; and \\n\\uf0b7  an asset (capped to its recoverable amount) if the fair value of the assets is greater than the obligation. \\nIn each reporting period, the movements in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as follows: \\n\\uf0b7  the net movement relating to the current period’s service cost, net interest on the defined benefit liability, past service costs and other \\ncosts (such as the effects of any curtailments and settlements) as operating expenses; \\n\\uf0b7  remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on scheme assets, excluding \\ninterest income included in net interest) directly in retained earnings through other comprehensive income; and \\n\\uf0b7  contributions of the Group directly against the net defined benefit position. \\nDefined contribution superannuation schemes \\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. It also contributes (according to local law, in the various countries in which \\nit operates) to Government and other plans that have the characteristics of defined contribution plans. The Group’s contributions to these \\nschemes are recognised as personnel expenses when they are incurred.   \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 229\\n229  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n30.

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued) \\nANZ SHARE OPTION PLAN \\nAllocation  We may grant selected employees options/rights which entitle them to acquire fully paid ordinary ANZ shares at a \\nfixed price at the time the options/rights vest. Voting and dividend rights will be attached to the ordinary shares \\nallocated on exercise of the options/rights. \\nEach option/right entitles the holder to one ordinary share subject to the terms and conditions imposed on grant. \\nExercise price of options, determined in accordance with the rules of the plan, is generally based on the VWAP of the \\nshares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant. For rights, the exercise price is nil. \\nRules   Prior to the exercise of the option/right if ANZ changes its share capital due to a bonus share issue, pro-rata new share \\nissue or reorganisation the following adjustments are required: \\n\\uf0b7  Issue of bonus shares - When the holder exercises their option, they are also entitled to be issued the number of \\nbonus shares they would have been entitled to had they held the underlying shares at the time of the                  \\nbonus issue; \\n\\uf0b7  Pro-rata share offer - We will adjust the exercise price of the option in the manner set out in the ASX Listing            \\nRules; and \\n\\uf0b7  Reorganisation - In respect of rights, if there is a bonus issue or reorganisation of ANZ’s share capital, then the \\nBoard may adjust the number of rights or the number of underlying shares so that there is no advantage or \\ndisadvantage to the holder. \\nHolders otherwise have no other entitlements to participate: \\n\\uf0b7  in any new issue of ANZ securities before they exercise their options/rights; or  \\n\\uf0b7  in a share issue of a body corporate other than ANZ (such as a subsidiary). \\nAny portion of the award which vests may, at the Board’s discretion, be satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather \\nthan shares. \\nExpensing  We expense the fair value of options/rights on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period and we recognise \\nthe expense as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. \\nCessation  The provisions that apply if the employee’s employment ends are in section 8.2.3 of the 2021 Remuneration Report. \\nMalus (downward  ANZ’s malus (downward adjustment) provisions are detailed in section 5.3 of the 2021 Remuneration Report. \\nadjustment) \\n \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 233\\n233  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n31.

Further details on the performance hurdles are in \\nsection 5.2.3a of the 2021 Remuneration Report. \\nSatisfying vesting  Any portion of the award of performance rights (that have met the performance hurdles) may be satisfied by a \\ncash equivalent payment rather than shares at the Board’s discretion. In 2021, the performance rights that \\nvested (previously granted in November/December 2017) were satisfied through a share allocation, other than \\n36,103 performance rights for which a cash payment was made. In 2020, all performance rights (previously \\ngranted in November/December 2016) lapsed due to not meeting the performance hurdles.  \\n2021 and 2020 grants  During the 2021 year, we granted 485,032 performance rights (2020: 520,172). \\nMalus (downward adjustment)  Board discretion was not exercised to adjust downward any performance rights in 2021 (2020: nil). \\nii) Deferred Share Rights (no performance hurdles) \\nAllocation  Deferred share rights provide the holder with the right to acquire ANZ shares at nil cost after a specified vesting \\nperiod. We adjust the fair value of rights for the absence of dividends during the restriction period. Also, see \\nsection 5.2.3b of the 2021 Remuneration Report. \\nSatisfying vesting  Any portion of the award of share rights may be satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather than shares at the \\nBoard’s discretion. All share rights were satisfied through a share allocation, other than 89,296 deferred share \\nrights (2020: 99,891) for which a cash payment was made. \\n2021 and 2020 grants  During the 2021 year, 2,258,774 deferred share rights (no performance hurdles) were granted (2020: 2,393,424). \\nMalus (downward adjustment)  Board discretion was exercised to adjust downward 8,414 deferred share rights to zero in 2021 (2020: nil). \\n \\n\\xa0  \\n234\\n234 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n31.

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued) \\nFair Value Assumptions \\nWhen determining the fair value, we apply the standard market techniques for valuation, including Monte Carlo and/or Black Scholes pricing models. \\nWe do so in accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payments. The models take into account early exercise of vested equity, non-\\ntransferability and internal/external performance hurdles (if any).  \\nThe table below shows the significant assumptions we used as inputs into our fair value calculation of instruments granted during the period.

Relates to grants made in November 2019. \\n2. Expected volatility represents a measure of the amount by which ANZ’s share price is expected to fluctuate over the life of the rights. The measure of volatility used in the model is the annualised standard \\ndeviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the historical share price over a defined period of time preceding the date of grant. This historical average annualised volatility is then used to \\nestimate a reasonable expected volatility over the expected life of the rights. \\nSATISFYING EQUITY AWARDS \\nAll shares underpinning equity awards may be purchased on market, reallocated or be newly issued shares, or a combination. \\nThe equity we purchased on market during the 2021 financial year (either under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option \\nPlan, or to satisfy options or rights) for all employees amounted to 3,593,574 shares at an average price of $22.03 per share (2020: 4,882,936 shares at \\nan average price of $25.06 per share). \\n236\\n236 32.

ANZ \\nhas enjoyed an association with the Art Gallery of NSW since 2010, through its sponsorship of various annually awarded art prizes and it has been a \\nLeadership Partner since 2017. The transaction between the Group and the Art Gallery New South Wales is not a related party transaction for \\naccounting purposes. \\nOther transactions with KMP and their related parties included amounts paid to the Group in respect of investment management service fees, \\nbrokerage and bank fees and charges. The Group has reimbursed KMP for the costs incurred for security and secretarial services associated with the \\nperformance of their duties.

Many of these facilities \\nare expected to be only partially used, and others may never be used at all. As such, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not necessarily \\nrepresentative of future liquidity risks or future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group or the Company may be required to \\npay, the full amount of undrawn facilities for the Group and the Company mature within 12 months. \\nGUARANTEES, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE RELATED CONTINGENCIES \\nGuarantees, letters of credit and performance related contingencies relate to transactions that the Group has entered into as principal – including \\nguarantees, standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit. \\nDocumentary letters of credit involve the Group issuing letters of credit guaranteeing payment in favour of an exporter. They are secured against an \\nunderlying shipment of goods or backed by a confirmatory letter of credit from another bank. \\nPerformance related contingencies are liabilities that oblige the Group to make payments to a third party if the customer fails to fulfil its non-monetary \\nobligations under the contract. \\nTo reflect the risk associated with these transactions, we apply the same credit origination, portfolio management and collateral requirements that we \\napply to loans. The contract amount represents the maximum potential amount that we could lose if the counterparty fails to meet its financial \\nobligations. As the facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Based \\non the earliest date on which the Group or the Company may be required to pay, the full amount of guarantees and letters of credit and performance \\nrelated contingencies for the Group and the Company mature within 12 months. \\n \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 239\\n239  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n \\n33. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued) \\nOTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES \\nAs at 30 September 2021, the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of the matters outlined below. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been \\nobtained and, in the light of such advice, provisions (refer to Note 22 Other Provisions) and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. In \\nsome instances we have not disclosed the estimated financial impact of the individual items either because it is not practicable to do so or because \\nsuch disclosure may prejudice the interests of the Group. \\nREGULATORY AND CUSTOMER EXPOSURES \\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the number of matters on which the Group engages with its regulators. There have also been significant \\nincreases in the nature and scale of regulatory investigations, surveillance and reviews, civil and criminal enforcement actions (whether by court action \\nor otherwise), formal and informal inquiries, regulatory supervisory activities and the quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against \\nfinancial institutions both in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of \\nboth industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions \\ncan be wide ranging and, for example, include or have included a range of matters including responsible lending practices, regulated lending \\nrequirements, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, \\ninsurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering \\nand counter-terrorism financing obligations, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to \\ncustomers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or \\ncompensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain. \\nBENCHMARK/RATE ACTIONS \\nIn July and August 2016, class action complaints were brought in the United States District Court against local and international banks, including the \\nCompany – one action relating to the bank bill swap rate (BBSW), and one action relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and the \\nSingapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). The class actions are expressed to apply to persons and entities that engaged in US-based transactions in financial \\ninstruments that were priced, benchmarked, and/or settled based on BBSW or SIBOR. The claimants seek damages or compensation in amounts not \\nspecified, and allege that the defendant banks, including the Company, violated US anti-trust laws and (in the BBSW case only) antiracketeering laws, \\nthe Commodity Exchange Act, and unjust enrichment principles. In March 2021, the Company reached an agreement to settle the BBSW class action. \\nThe settlement is without admission of liability and remains subject to negotiation and execution of complete settlement terms as well as court \\napproval. The financial impact of the settlement is not material and has been fully provided at 31 March 2021. The separate class action in relation to \\nSIBOR is ongoing and is being defended. \\nIn February 2017, the South African Competition Commission commenced proceedings against local and international banks including the Company \\nalleging breaches of the cartel provisions of the South African Competition Act in respect of trading in the South African rand. The potential civil \\npenalty or other financial impact is uncertain. \\nCAPITAL RAISING ACTIONS  \\nIn June 2018, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions commenced criminal proceedings against a number of companies and individuals, \\nincluding the Company and a senior employee. It is alleged that the joint lead managers of the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional \\nequity placement engaged in cartel conduct and that the Company and its senior employee were involved in one of those joint lead managers giving \\neffect to a cartel. The Company and its senior employee are defending the allegations. The trial is currently scheduled to start in April 2022. \\nIn September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging \\nfailure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement. \\nASIC alleges the Company should have advised the market that the joint lead managers took up approximately 25.5 million ordinary shares of the \\nplacement. The Company is defending the allegations. \\nCONSUMER CREDIT INSURANCE LITIGATION \\nIn February 2020, a class action was brought against the Company alleging breaches of financial advice obligations, misleading or deceptive conduct \\nand unconscionable conduct in relation to the distribution of consumer credit insurance products. The issuers of the insurance products, QBE and \\nOnePath Life, are also defendants to the claim. The Company is defending the allegations. \\nESANDA DEALER CAR LOAN LITIGATION \\nIn August 2020, a class action was brought against the Company alleging unfair conduct, misleading or deceptive conduct and equitable mistake in \\nrelation to the use of flex commissions in dealer arranged Esanda car loans. The Company is defending the allegations. \\nONEPATH SUPERANNUATION LITIGATION \\nIn December 2020, a class action was brought against OnePath Custodians, OnePath Life and the Company alleging that OnePath Custodians \\nbreached its obligations under superannuation legislation, and its duties as trustee, in respect of superannuation investments and fees. The claim also \\nalleges that the Company was involved in some of OnePath Custodians’ investment breaches. The Company is defending the allegations. \\n\\xa0  \\n240\\n240 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Notes to the financial statements (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\n33.

ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited is defending the \\nallegations. \\nROYAL COMMISSION \\nThe Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry released its final report on 4 February 2019. \\nFollowing the Royal Commission there have been, and continue to be, additional costs and further exposures, including exposures associated with \\nfurther regulator activity or potential customer exposures such as class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. \\nThe outcomes and total costs associated with these possible exposures remain uncertain. \\nSECURITY RECOVERY ACTIONS \\nVarious claims have been made or are anticipated, arising from security recovery actions taken to resolve impaired assets. These claims will be \\ndefended. \\nWARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES \\nThe Group has provided warranties, indemnities and other commitments in favour of the purchaser and other persons in connection with various \\ndisposals of businesses and assets and other transactions, covering a range of matters and risks. It is exposed to claims under those warranties, \\nindemnities and commitments. \\nCLEARING AND SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS \\nCertain group companies have a commitment to comply with rules governing various clearing and settlement arrangements which could result in a \\ncredit risk exposure and loss if another member institution fails to settle its payment clearing activities. The Group’s potential exposure arising from \\nthese arrangements is unquantifiable in advance. \\nCertain group companies hold memberships of central clearing houses, including ASX Clear (Futures), London Clearing House (LCH) SwapClear and \\nRepoClear, Korea Exchange (KRX), Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX), Clearing Corporation of India and the Shanghai Clearing House. These memberships \\nallow the relevant group company to centrally clear derivative instruments in line with cross-border regulatory requirements. Common to all of these \\nmemberships is the requirement for the relevant group company to make default fund contributions. In the event of a default by another member, \\nthe relevant group company could potentially be required to commit additional default fund contributions which are unquantifiable in advance. \\nPARENT ENTITY GUARANTEES \\nThe Company has issued letters of comfort and guarantees in respect of certain subsidiaries in the normal course of business. Under these letters and \\nguarantees, the Company undertakes to ensure that those subsidiaries continue to meet their financial obligations, subject to certain conditions \\nincluding that the entity remains a controlled entity of the Company. \\nSALE OF GRINDLAYS BUSINESSES \\nOn 31 July 2000, the Company completed the sale to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited (Grindlays) and certain other \\nbusinesses. The Company provided warranties and indemnities relating to those businesses. \\nThe indemnified matters include civil penalty proceedings and criminal prosecutions brought by Indian authorities against Grindlays and certain of its \\nofficers, in relation to certain transactions conducted in 1991 that are alleged to have breached the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. \\nCivil penalties were imposed in 2007 which are the subject of appeals. The criminal prosecutions are being defended. \\nCONTINGENT ASSETS \\nNATIONAL HOUSING BANK \\nThe Company is pursuing recovery of the proceeds of certain disputed cheques which were credited to the account of a former Grindlays customer in \\nthe early 1990s. \\nThe disputed cheques were drawn on the National Housing Bank (NHB) in India. Proceedings between Grindlays and NHB concerning the proceeds of \\nthe cheques were resolved in early 2002. \\nRecovery is now being pursued from the estate of the Grindlays customer who received the cheque proceeds. Any amounts recovered are to be \\nshared between the Company and NHB. \\n \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 241\\n241 34.

Refer to Note 1 About Our Financial Statements for further details.  \\nINTRAGROUP TRANSACTIONS WITH CONSOLIDATED SECURITISATION STRUCTURED ENTITIES \\nDuring the 2021 financial year, the Company changed its accounting policy relating to intragroup transactions with consolidated securitisation SEs in \\nwhich it holds all of the issued securities of the SE. These internal securitisation transactions provide an additional source of liquidity for the Group by \\ncreating residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) which can be sold under repurchase agreements with relevant central banks. A distinguishing \\nfeature of these transactions is that all of the RMBS issued by the SE are held by the Company, rather than purchased by third parties. By holding all of \\nthe RMBS issued by the SE, the Company retains all of the risk and rewards of the mortgages transferred to the SE which cannot be derecognised for \\naccounting purposes. Furthermore, because the intragroup transactions with the SE fully offset each other, they do not alter the cash position, assets \\nor future cash flows of the Company. Accordingly, under this policy change, these transactions will no longer be recorded on a gross basis. Rather, the \\nCompany will recognise a net nil position with the SE in order to better reflect the economic substance of the intragroup transactions.  \\nThis accounting policy change has no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements given the previously recorded intercompany balances \\nwere eliminated in consolidation. Comparatives have been restated in the financial statements of the Company as follows: \\n  2020 \\nThe Company  $m \\nIncome Statement \\nInterest income  (2,377) \\nInterest expense  2,929 \\nNet interest income  552 \\nOther operating income  (552) \\nNet profit after tax  - \\n   \\nBalance Sheet   \\nDue from controlled entities  (76,637) \\nTotal assets  (76,637) \\nDue to controlled entities  (76,637) \\nTotal liabilities  (76,637) \\nNet assets  - \\n\\xa0\\n36.

These models are \\nreliant on data and a number of estimates including the impact of multiple economic scenarios and other assumptions such as defining a significant \\nincrease in credit risk (SICR).  \\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments requires the Company and Group to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of economic conditions, \\nof which gross domestic product (GDP) and unemployment levels are considered key assumptions. Post-model adjustments are made by the \\nCompany and Group to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in \\nchallenging the economic scenarios used and the judgmental post model adjustments the Company and Group applies to the ECL results. \\nThe Company and Group’s criteria selected to identify a SICR, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), are key areas of judgement within the \\nCompany and Group’s ECL methodology as these criteria determine if a forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded.  \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has meant that assumptions regarding the economic outlook are more uncertain which, combined with varying \\ngovernment responses, increases the level of judgement required by the Company and Group in calculating the ECL, and the associated audit risk.   \\nAdditionally, allowances for individually assessed wholesale loans exceeding specific thresholds are individually assessed by the Company and Group. \\nWe exercise significant judgement in challenging the assessment of specific allowances based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated \\nproceeds from the value of the collateral held by the Company and Group in respect of the loans. \\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit \\nOur audit procedures for the allowance for ECL and disclosures included assessing the Company and Group’s significant accounting policies against \\nthe requirements of the accounting standard. Additionally, our procedures included: \\nTesting key controls of the Company and Group in relation to: \\n\\uf0b7  The ECL model governance and validation processes which involved assessment of model performance; \\n\\uf0b7  The assessment and approval of the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by the \\nCompany and Group’s internal governance processes; \\n\\uf0b7  Reconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems;  \\n\\uf0b7  Customer credit rating (CCR) for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). This covered elements such as: approval \\nof new lending facilities against the Company and Group’s lending policies, monitoring of counterparty credit quality against the Company and \\nGroup’s exposure criteria for internal factors specific to the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and accuracy and timeliness of CCR \\nand security indicator (SI) assessments against the requirements of the Company and Group’s lending policies and regulatory requirements; and  \\n\\uf0b7  IT system controls which record retail loans lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We \\ntested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the Company and Group’s oversight of the portfolios, with a focus \\non controls over delinquency monitoring. \\nWe tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) in relation to the key IT applications used by the Company and Group in \\nmeasuring ECL allowances as detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below. \\nIn addition to controls testing, our procedures included: \\n\\uf0b7  Re-performing credit assessments of a sample of wholesale loans controlled by the Company and Group’s specialist workout and recovery team \\nassessed as higher risk or impaired, and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Company and Group as showing \\nsigns of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk (assessed against external market conditions and in particular considering the impacts of COVID-\\n19 and climate change). For each loan sampled, we challenged management’s assessment of CCR and SI, taking into account our assessment of \\nthe customer’s financial position and, where relevant, the risk of stranded assets, and our overall assessment of loan recoverability, the valuation of \\nsecurity, and the impact on the credit allowance. To do this, we used the information on the Company’s and Group’s loan file, discussed the facts \\nand circumstances of the case with the loan officer, and performed our own assessment of recoverability. Exercising our judgement, our \\nprocedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macroeconomic environment and comparing data and assumptions \\nused by the Company and Group in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices, publicly available \\naudited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant we assessed the forecast timing of future cash \\nflows in the context of underlying valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions in the valuations; \\n\\uf0b7  Obtaining an understanding of the Company and Group’s processes to determine ECL allowances, evaluating the Company and Group’s ECL \\nmodel methodologies against established market practices and criteria in the accounting standards; \\n\\xa0  \\n246\\n246 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Independent auditor's report (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued) \\n\\uf0b7  Working with our risk consulting specialists, we assessed the accuracy of the Company and Group’s ECL model estimates by re-performing, for a \\nsample of loans, the ECL allowance using our independently derived calculation tools and comparing this to the amount recorded by the \\nCompany and Group; \\n\\uf0b7  Working with our economic specialists, we challenged the Company and Group’s forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenarios \\nincorporated in the Company and Group’s ECL models. We compared the Company and Group’s forecast GDP, unemployment rates, CPI and \\nproperty price indices to relevant publicly available macro-economic information, and considered other known variables and information obtained \\nthrough our other audit procedures to identify contradictory indicators; \\n\\uf0b7  Testing the implementation of the Company and Group’s SICR methodology by re-performing the staging calculation for a sample of loans taking \\ninto consideration movements in the CCR from loan origination CCR and comparing our expectation to actual staging applied on an individual \\naccount level in the Company and Group’s ECL model; and  \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the accuracy of the data used in the ECL models by confirming a sample of data fields such as account balance and CCR to relevant \\nsource systems. \\nWe challenged key assumptions in the components of the Company and Group’s post-model adjustments to the ECL allowance balance. This \\nincluded: \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the requirement for additional allowances considering the Company and Group’s ECL model and data deficiencies identified by the \\nCompany and Group’s ECL model validation processes, particularly in light of the extreme volatility in economic scenarios caused by the current \\nCOVID-19 pandemic and government responses; \\n\\uf0b7  Evaluating underlying data used in concentration risk and economic cycle allowances by comparing underlying loan portfolio characteristics to \\nrecent loss experience, current market conditions and specific risks in the Group’s loan portfolios;   \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the impacts on the modelled ECL and the requirement for out of model adjustments to account for the expected increase in \\ndelinquencies. We also assessed assumptions used to determine whether a SICR event has occurred; and \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the completeness of additional allowance overlays by checking the consistency of risks we identified in the loan portfolios against the \\nCompany and Group’s assessment. \\nSUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE: \\nGROUP \\n- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 ASSET POSITIONS $1,497m                  \\n- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 ASSET POSITIONS $57,116m \\n- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 LIABILITY POSITIONS $30m \\n- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 LIABILITY POSITIONS $41,343m   \\nCOMPANY \\n- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 ASSET POSITIONS $1,190m                  \\n- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 ASSET POSITIONS $55,533m   \\n- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 LIABILITY POSITIONS $30m \\n- FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 LIABILITY POSITIONS $39,146m   \\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures of fair values in Note 18 to the Financial Report. \\nThe Key Audit Matter \\nThe fair value of the Company and Group’s Level 3 and 2 financial instruments is determined by the application of valuation techniques which often \\ninvolve the exercise of judgement and the use of assumptions and estimates.   \\nThe valuation of Level 3 and level 2 financial instruments held at fair value is considered a Key Audit Matter due to: \\n\\uf0b7  The high degree of estimation uncertainty and potentially significant range of reasonable outcomes associated with the valuation of financial \\ninstruments classified as Level 3 where significant pricing inputs used in the valuation methodology and models are not observable. Level 3 \\nfinancial instruments represented 0.8% and 0.9% respectively of the Company and Group’s financial assets and 0.07% and 0.06% of the Company \\nand Group’s financial liabilities carried at fair value; and  \\n\\uf0b7  The complexity associated with the valuation methodology and models of certain more complex Level 2 financial instruments leading to an \\nincrease in subjectivity and estimation uncertainty. Level 2 financial instruments represented 39% and 35% respectively of the Company and \\nGroup’s financial assets and 88% and 89% of the Company and Group’s financial liabilities carried at fair value. \\n   \\nANZ 2021 Annual Report 247\\n247  ANZ 2021O AVNENURAVL IREEPWORT  HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued)\\n \\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued) \\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit \\nOur audit procedures for the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value included: \\n\\uf0b7  Performing an assessment of the population of financial instruments held at fair value to identify portfolios that have a higher risk of misstatement \\narising from significant judgements over valuation either due to unobservable inputs or complex models. \\n\\uf0b7  Testing the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating specifically to these financial instruments, including: \\n\\uf0b7  Controls in relation to Independent Price Verification (IPV), including completeness of portfolios and valuation inputs subject to IPV;  \\n\\uf0b7  Controls in relation to model validation at inception and periodically, including assessment of model limitation and assumptions; \\n\\uf0b7  Controls in relation to the review and challenge of daily profit and loss by a control function; \\n\\uf0b7  Controls over the collateral management process, including review of margin reconciliations with clearing houses; and  \\n\\uf0b7  Controls over fair value adjustments (FVAs), including exit price and portfolio level adjustments. \\n\\uf0b7  With the assistance of our valuation specialists, independently re-valuing a selection of financial instruments and FVAs. This involved sourcing \\nindependent inputs from market data providers or external sources and using our own valuation models.  \\n\\uf0b7  In relation to the subjective valuation of Level 3 financial instruments, where appropriate, with our valuation specialists: \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions using comparable data in the market and available alternatives; and \\n\\uf0b7  Comparing the Company and Group’s valuation methodology to industry practice and the criteria in the accounting standards. \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the financial statements disclosures, including key judgements and assumptions using our understanding obtained from our testing and \\nagainst the relevant accounting standard requirements. \\nCARRYING VALUE OF INVESTMENT IN ASIAN ASSOCIATES (Group $1,929m; Company $Nil) \\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 26 to the Financial Report. \\nThe Key Audit Matter \\nCarrying value of investment in Asian associates (PT Panin and AmBank) is a key audit matter as: \\n\\uf0b7  The Group’s impairment assessment of non-lending assets identified that two of the Group’s associate investments (PT Panin and AmBank) had \\nindicators of impairment.  \\n\\uf0b7  Significant judgement was required by the Group as a result of the business disruption and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, raising \\nestimation uncertainty. These conditions and the uncertainty of their continuation increases the possibility of the investments in the associates \\nbeing impaired, and the risk of inaccurate forecasts or a significantly wider range of possible outcomes in the cash flow models.  \\n\\uf0b7  Our evaluation of potential impairment involves critically evaluating the Group’s judgement in relation to key forward-looking assumptions for the \\nGroup’s Asian associates. Instances where the Group’s judgement is evaluated include: \\n\\uf0b7  Forecast earnings and terminal growth rates – The Group’s models are highly sensitive to small changes in these assumptions, reducing \\navailable headroom or indicating possible impairment.  This drives additional audit effort specific to their feasibility and consistency of \\napplication; and \\n\\uf0b7  Discount rates – These are complicated in nature and vary according to the conditions and environment the specific associate investments \\noperate in. \\n\\uf0b7  We involved our valuation specialists to supplement our senior team members in assessing this key audit matter. \\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit \\nWorking with our valuation specialists, our procedures included: \\n\\uf0b7  Considering the appropriateness of the value in use valuation method applied by the Group to perform their annual test for impairment against \\nthe requirements of the accounting standards;  \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the integrity of the models used, including the accuracy of the underlying calculation formulas;  \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the Group’s key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model, such as, discount rates, growth rates, forecast earnings and \\nterminal growth rate by comparing to external observable metrics, historical experience, our knowledge of the markets and current market \\npractice; \\n\\uf0b7  Independently developing a discount rate estimate or range considered comparable using publicly available market data for comparable entities, \\nadjusted for factors specific to the Asian associates and the market and industry they operate in; \\n\\uf0b7  Comparing the forecast cash flows contained in the models to recent broker consensus reports, reflecting the COVID-19 impacts;   \\n\\uf0b7  Considering and challenging the Group’s assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on cash flows and assumptions as well as its assessment of the \\nlikely recovery period; \\n\\uf0b7  Considering the sensitivity of the models by varying key assumptions, such as, forecast growth rates, terminal growth rates and discount rates, \\nwithin a reasonable possible range, including specific analysis of reasonable possible impacts of COVID-19; \\n\\xa0  \\n248\\n248 OVERVIEW HOW WE   PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  DIRECTORS’  FINANCIAL  SHAREHOLDER     Independent auditor's report (contNinOuTEeS TdO) THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nCREATE VALUE OVERVIEW REPORT REPORT REPORT INFORMATION\\n \\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued) \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the recoverable amount at the reporting date against the recoverable amount of each investment when it was last impaired to assess if \\nany reversal of previous impairment loss was required; and   \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the disclosures in the financial report using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the \\naccounting standards.  \\nPROVISIONS FOR CUSTOMER REMEDIATION (Group $886m; Company $791m) \\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 22 and 33 to the Financial Report. \\nThe Key Audit Matter \\nThe Company and Group have assessed the need to recognise provisions in relation to certain customer remediation activities arising from both \\ninternal and external investigations and reviews.  \\nThe provision for customer remediation activities is a key audit matter due to the judgements required by us in assessing the Company and Group’s \\ndetermination of: \\n\\uf0b7  The completeness of the population of matters requiring remediation; \\n\\uf0b7  The existence of a present legal or constructive obligation arising from a past event using the conditions of the event against the criteria in the \\naccounting standards; \\n\\uf0b7  Reliable estimates of the amounts which may be paid arising from investigations, including estimates of related costs; and \\n\\uf0b7  The potential for legal proceedings, further investigations, and reviews from its regulators leading to a wider range of estimation outcomes for us to \\nconsider. \\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit \\nOur audit procedures for customer remediation provisions included: \\n\\uf0b7  Obtaining an understanding of the Company and Group’s processes and controls for identifying and assessing the potential impact of the \\ninvestigations into customer remediation activities; \\n\\uf0b7  Enquiring with the Company and Group regarding ongoing legal, regulatory and other investigation into remediation activities; \\n\\uf0b7  Conducting independent discussions on significant matters with external legal counsel; \\n\\uf0b7  Reading the minutes and other relevant documentation of the Company’s Board of Directors, Board Committees, various management \\ncommittees, and attending the Company’s Audit and Risk Committee meetings; \\n\\uf0b7  Inspecting correspondence with relevant regulatory bodies; \\n\\uf0b7  For a sample of individual customer remediation matters, we evaluate the basis for recognition of a provision and associated costs against the \\nrequirements of the accounting standards.

We work with our IT specialists as a core part of our \\naudit team. \\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit \\nTesting the technology control environment for key IT applications (systems) used in processing significant transactions and recording balances in the \\ngeneral ledger, and testing the automated controls embedded within these systems which link the technology-enabled business processes. Our audit \\nprocedures included:  \\n\\uf0b7  Assessing the governance and higher-level controls across the IT Environment, including those regarding policy design, review and awareness, and \\nIT Risk Management practices;  \\n\\uf0b7  Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls across the User Access Management Lifecycle, including how users are on-boarded, \\nreviewed, and removed on a timely basis from critical IT applications and supporting infrastructure. We also examined how privileged roles and \\nfunctions are managed across each IT Application and the supporting infrastructure;  \\n\\uf0b7  Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls to enable Change Management including how changes are initiated, documented, \\napproved, tested and authorised prior to migration into the production environment of critical IT Applications. We assessed the appropriateness of \\nusers with access to release changes to IT application production environments across the Company and Group;  \\n\\uf0b7  Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls used by the Company and Group’s technology teams to schedule system jobs and monitor \\nsystem integrity;  \\n\\uf0b7  Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls related to significant IT application programs delivered per the ANZ Delivery Framework; \\n\\uf0b7  Design and operating effectiveness testing of automated business process controls including those relating to enforcing segregation of duties to \\navoid conflicts from inappropriate role combinations within IT applications. Testing: \\n\\uf0b7  Configurations in place to perform calculations, mappings and flagging of financial transactions, and automated reconciliation controls (both \\nbetween systems and intra-system); and \\n\\uf0b7  Data integrity of critical system reporting used by us in our audit to select samples and analyse data used by management to generate \\nfinancial reporting. \\nOTHER INFORMATION \\nOther Information is both financial and non-financial information in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited’s annual reporting which is \\nprovided in addition to the Financial Report and the Auditor's Report.
