Compliance\\nwith Australian Accounting Standards ensures that the financial statements and notes also comply with \\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards. Material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this financial\\nreport are presented below and have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.\\nThe financial report has been prepared on an accruals basis and is based on historical costs, modified, where \\napplicable, by the measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial liabilities.\\nAll amounts in the financial report have been rounded to the nearest dollar. Tables may not cast in all instances due\\nto rounding.\\nJupiter Mines Limited is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.\\n(a) Principles of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of entities controlled by\\nJupiter Mines Limited at the end of the reporting year. A controlled entity is any entity over which Jupiter Mines\\nLimited has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities.\\nControl will generally exist when the parent owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of\\nthe voting power of an entity. In assessing the power to govern, the existence and effect of holdings of actual\\nand potential voting rights are considered.\\nA list of controlled entities is contained in Note 13 to the financial statements.\\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, all inter-Group balances and transactions between entities in\\nthe Consolidated Group have been eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been\\nchanged where necessary to ensure consistency with those adopted by the parent entity.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nThe Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations.  The consideration \\ntransferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair\\nvalues of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the\\nfair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement.  Acquisition costs are \\nexpensed as incurred.\\nThe Group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless\\nof whether they have been previously recognised in the acquiree’s financial statements prior to the acquisition.\\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally measured at their acquisition-date fair values.  \\nGoodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets.  It is calculated as the excess of the\\nsum of: (a) fair value of consideration transferred, (b) the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in\\nthe acquire, and (c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the \\nacquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets.  If the fair values of identifiable net assets exceed the sum\\ncalculated above, the excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is recognised in profit or loss immediately.  \\n17\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n(b) Interests in Joint Ventures\\nThe Group acquired an interest in Tshipi é Ntle Manganese Mining Proprietary Limited (“Tshipi”), a joint venture\\nentity, in October 2010. The Group’s accounting policy for joint ventures was considered by the Directors as part\\nof the deliberation on the Tshipi acquisition, and had not been formally considered or articulated previously.\\nAssociates are those entities over which the Group is able to exert significant influence but which are not \\nsubsidiaries.\\nA joint venture is an arrangement that the Group controls jointly with one or more other investors, and over\\nwhich the Group has rights to a share of the arrangement’s net assets rather than direct rights to underlying \\nassets and obligations for underlying liabilities.\\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\\nAny goodwill or fair value adjustment attributable to the Group’s share in the associate or joint venture is not\\nrecognised separately and is included in the amount recognised as investment.\\nThe carrying amount of the investment in associates and joint ventures is increased or decreased to recognise\\nthe Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate and joint venture, \\nadjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies of the Group.\\nUnrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are \\neliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in those entities. Where unrealised losses are eliminated, the \\nunderlying asset is also tested for impairment. \\n(c) Income Tax\\nThe income tax expense (revenue) for the year comprises current income tax expense (income) and deferred\\ntax expense (income).\\nCurrent income tax expense charged to profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income. Current tax liabilities\\n(assets) are measured at the amounts expected to be paid to (recovered from) the relevant taxation authority.\\nDeferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during\\nthe year as well unused tax losses.\\nCurrent and deferred income tax expense (income) is charged or credited outside profit or loss when the tax \\nrelates to items that are recognised outside profit or loss.\\nExcept for business combinations, no deferred income tax is recognised from the initial recognition of an asset\\nor liability, where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the\\nasset is realised or the liability is settled and their measurement also reflects the manner in which management\\nexpects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability.\\nDeferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent\\nthat it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset\\ncan be utilised.\\nWhere temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates, and joint \\nventures, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary\\ndifference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.\\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended\\nthat net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where: (a) a legally enforceable right of set-off exists; and (b) the\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the\\nsame taxable entity or different taxable entities where it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous \\nrealisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur in future years in which significant\\namounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled.\\n18\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n(d) Property, Plant and Equipment\\nEach class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost or fair value as indicated less, where applicable,\\nany accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\\nPlant and equipment\\nPlant and equipment are measured on the cost basis.\\nThe carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed annually by directors to ensure it is not in excess of the\\nrecoverable amount from these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected net\\ncash flows that will be received from the asset’s employment and subsequent disposal. The expected net cash\\nflows have been discounted to their present values in determining recoverable amounts.\\nThe cost of fixed assets constructed within the Consolidated Group includes the cost of materials, direct labour,\\nborrowing costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable overheads.\\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,\\nonly when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the\\ncost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of\\ncomprehensive income during the financial year in which they are incurred.\\nDepreciation\\nThe depreciable amount of all fixed assets is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives to the\\nConsolidated Group commencing from the time the asset is held ready for use.\\nThe depreciation rates used for each class of depreciable assets are:\\nClass of Fixed Asset Depreciation Rate\\nOffice equipment 33.33%\\nFurniture & fittings 33.33%\\nMotor vehicles 12.50%\\nLeasehold improvements 20.00%\\nBuildings 10.00%\\nThe assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.\\nAn asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying\\namount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.\\nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These gains\\nand losses are included in the statement of comprehensive income.\\n(e) Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure\\nThe application of the Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgment\\nin determining whether it is likely that future economic benefits are likely either from future exploitation or sale\\nor where activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of \\nreserves. The determination of a Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) resource is itself an estimation process\\nthat requires varying degrees of uncertainty depending on sub-classification and these estimates directly \\nimpact the point of deferral of exploration and evaluation expenditure. The deferral policy requires management\\nto make certain estimates and assumptions about future events or circumstances, in particular whether an \\neconomically viable extraction operation can be established. Estimates and assumptions made may change if\\nnew information becomes available. If, after expenditure is capitalised, information becomes available suggesting\\nthat the recovery of expenditure is unlikely, the amount capitalised is written off in the Statement of Profit or\\nLoss and Other Comprehensive Income in the year when the new information becomes available.\\n19\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n(f) Leases\\nLeases of fixed assets where substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to the ownership of the asset, but\\nnot the legal ownership that is transferred to entities in the Consolidated Group, are classified as finance leases.\\nFinance leases are capitalised by recognising an asset and a liability at the lower of the amounts equal to the fair\\nvalue of the leased property or the present value of the minimum lease payments, including any guaranteed\\nresidual values. Lease payments are allocated between the reduction of the lease liability and the lease interest\\nexpense for the year.\\nLeased assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease\\nterm.\\nLease payments for operating leases, where substantially all the risks and benefits remain with the lessor, are\\nrecognised as expenses in the years in which they are incurred.\\nLease incentives under operating leases are recognised as a liability and amortised on a straight-line basis over\\nthe lease term.\\n(g) Financial Assets\\nRecognition and initial measurement\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions to the instrument. For financial assets, this is equivalent to the date that the company commits itself\\nto either the purchase or sale of the asset (i.e. trade date accounting is adopted).\\nFinancial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except where the instrument is\\nclassified “at fair value through profit or loss”, in which case transaction costs are expensed to profit or loss \\nimmediately.\\nClassification and subsequent measurement\\nFinance instruments are subsequently measured at fair value, amortised cost using the effective interest rate\\nmethod, or cost.\\nAmortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition\\nless principal repayments and any reduction for impairment, and adjusted for any cumulative amortisation of\\nthe difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount calculated using the effective interest\\nmethod.\\nFair value is determined based on current bid prices for all quoted investments. Valuation techniques are \\napplied to determine the fair value for all unlisted securities, including recent arm’s length transactions, \\nreference to similar instruments and option pricing models.\\nThe effective interest method is used to allocate interest income or interest expense over the relevant period\\nand is equivalent to the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts (including fees, \\ntransaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life (or when this cannot be reliably\\npredicted, the contractual term) of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or\\nfinancial liability. Revisions to expected future net cash flows will necessitate an adjustment to the carrying value\\nwith a consequential recognition of an income or expense item in profit or loss.\\nThe Group does not designate any interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint venture entities as being subject\\nto the requirements of Accounting Standards specifically applicable to financial instruments.\\n(i) Loans and receivables\\nLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not\\nquoted in an active market and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\\n20\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nLoans and receivables are included in current assets, where they are expected to mature within 12 months\\nafter the end of the reporting period.\\nHeld-to-maturity investments\\nHeld-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets that have fixed maturities and fixed or \\ndeterminable payments, and it is the Group’s intention to hold these investments to maturity. They are \\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost.\\nHeld-to-maturity investments are included in non-current assets where they are expected to mature within\\n12 months after the end of the reporting period. All other investments are classified as current assets.\\n(ii) Available-for-sale financial assets\\nAvailable-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either not suitable to be \\nclassified into other categories of financial assets due to their nature, or they are designated as such by\\nmanagement. They comprise investments in the equity of other entities where there is neither a fixed \\nmaturity nor fixed or determinable payments.\\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value with changes in such fair value (i.e. gains or losses) recognised\\nin other comprehensive income (except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses).\\nWhen the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss pertaining to that asset previously\\nrecognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified into profit or loss.\\nAvailable-for-sale financial assets are included in current assets where they are expected to be sold within \\n12 months after the end of the reporting period. All other financial assets are classified as non-current assets.\\n(iii)Financial liabilities\\nNon-derivative financial liabilities (excluding financial guarantees) are subsequently measured at amortised\\ncost.\\nImpairment of Financial Assets\\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group assess whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset\\nhas been impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there\\nis objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events (a “loss event”) having occurred, which\\nhas an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset(s).\\nIn the case of available-for-sale financial assets, a significant or prolonged decline in the market value of the \\ninstrument is considered to constitute a loss event. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss \\nimmediately. Also, any cumulative decline in fair value previously recognised in other comprehensive income is\\nreclassified to profit or loss at this point.\\nIn the case of financial assets carried at amortised cost, loss events may include: indications that the debtors or\\na group of debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal\\npayments; indications that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; and changes in arrears or\\neconomic conditions that correlate with defaults.\\nFor financial assets carried at amortised cost (including loans and receivables), a separate allowance account is\\nused to reduce the carrying amount of financial assets impaired by credit losses. After having taken all possible\\nmeasures of recovery, if management establishes that the carrying amount cannot be recovered by any means,\\nat that point the written-off amounts are charged to the allowance account or the carrying amount of impaired\\nfinancial assets is reduced directly if no impairment amount was previously recognised in the allowance account.\\nWhen the terms of the financial assets that would otherwise have been past due or impaired have been \\nrenegotiated, the group recognises the impairment for such financial assets by taking into account the original\\nterms as if the terms have not been renegotiated so that the loss events have occurred are duly considered.\\n21\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n(h) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying values of its tangible and intangible assets to determine\\nwhether there is any indication that those assets have been impaired. If such an indication exists, the recoverable\\namount of the asset, being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use, is compared to\\nthe asset’s carrying value. Any excess of the asset’s carrying value over its recoverable amount is expensed to\\nthe statement of comprehensive income.\\nWhere it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the \\nrecoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\\nImpairment testing is performed annually for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives.\\n(i) Employee Benefits\\nProvision is made for the Company’s liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees\\nto reporting date. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have been measured at the\\namounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled. Employee benefits payable later than one year have\\nbeen measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made for those benefits. Those\\ncash flows are discounted using market yields on national government bonds with terms to maturity that match\\nthe expected timing of cash flows.\\n(j) Provisions\\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for\\nwhich it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will result and that outflow can be reliably measured.\\n(k) Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid\\ninvestments with original maturities of three months or less, less credit card facilities used. Bank overdrafts are\\nshown as short-term borrowings in liabilities.\\n(l) Trade and Other Receivables\\nTrade receivables, which generally have 30 day terms, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently\\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for impairment.\\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis at an operating unit level. Individual debts\\nthat are known to be uncollectible are written off when identified. An impairment provision is recognised when\\nthere is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the receivable.\\n(m) Revenue and Other Income\\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised when significant risks and rewards of the saleable product have\\ntransferred to the customer. Risks and rewards are considered passed to the customer upon delivery to the \\ncustomer’s control. This generally occurs when the product is physically transferred onto a vessel.\\nRevenue from inventory sales is measured at fair value of consideration received/receivable. Revenue is stated\\nafter deducting sales taxes, duties and levies.\\nThe price is determined on a provisional basis at the date of sale (cost insurance and freight). Adjustments to\\nthe sale price may occur based on variances in the metal or moisture content of the ore up to the date of final\\npricing. The period between provisional invoicing and final pricing is typically between 2 and 3 months. \\nAccordingly, the fair value of the original revenue and associated receivable is adjusted each reporting period by\\nreference to the best estimate of the actual metal and moisture content. The changes in fair value are recorded\\nas an adjustment to revenue.\\nInterest revenue is recognised using the effective interest rate method, which, for floating rate financial assets, is\\nthe rate inherent in the instrument.\\nAll revenue is stated net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST).\\n22\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n(n) Borrowing Costs\\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets that necessarily\\ntake a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets,\\nuntil such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.\\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they\\nare incurred.\\n(o) Goods and Services Tax (GST)\\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST \\nincurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).\\nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of\\nGST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of\\nfinancial position.\\nCash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing\\nactivities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are presented as operating cash flows included in\\nreceipts from customers or payments to suppliers.\\n(p) Trade and Other Payables\\nTrade and other payables are carried at cost and due to their short time nature they are not discounted. They\\nrepresent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial period that are\\nunpaid and arise when Jupiter becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these\\ngoods and services. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.\\n(q) Comparative Figures\\nWhen required by Accounting Standards, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in\\npresentation for the current financial period.\\n(r) Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\\nThe Directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial report based on historical\\nknowledge and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events\\nand are based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group.\\nKey estimates – Impairment of non-financial assets\\nThe Group assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group that may\\nlead to impairment of assets. Where an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is \\ndetermined.\\nKey estimates – Options\\nThe fair value of services received in return for options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of\\noptions granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black Scholes\\noption-pricing model. The contractual life of the options is used as an input into the model. Expectations of\\nearly exercise are incorporated into the model as well. \\nThe expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of peer Group entities (calculated on the weighted \\naverage remaining life of the share options), adjusted for any expected changes to volatility due to publicly\\navailable information. \\n23\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nKey judgements – Exploration and evaluation expenditure\\nThe Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items of expenditure\\nbeing capitalised for an area of interest where it is considered likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or\\nsale or where the activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of\\nreserves. This policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and\\ncircumstances, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any such\\nestimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalised the\\nexpenditure under the policy, a judgement is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant \\ncapitalised amount will be written off to the statement of comprehensive income. \\n(s) Share based payments\\nUnder AASB 2 share based payments, the Company is required to determine the fair value of options issued to\\nemployees as remuneration and recognise as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income. This \\nstandard is not limited to options and also extends to other forms of equity-based remuneration.\\n(t) Foreign Currency Translation\\n(i) Functional and presentation currency\\nThe functional and presentation currency of Jupiter and its subsidiaries is Australian dollars ($). The \\npresentation and functional currency for the interest in Tshipi is the South African Rand.\\nThe results are translated into Australian dollars for disclosure in Jupiter’s consolidated accounts.\\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using\\nthe exchange rate as at the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign \\ncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.\\n(ii) Translation of interest in Joint Venture functional currency to presentation currency\\nThe results of the South African Joint Venture interest are translated into Australian dollars using an average\\nrate over the period of the transactions. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at\\nreporting dates.\\n(u) Adoption of New and Revised accounting standards and interpretations\\nDuring the current period, Jupiter adopted all of the new and revised Australian Accounting Standards and \\nInterpretations applicable to its operations which became mandatory. The adoption of these standards has \\nimpacted the recognition, measurement and disclosure of certain transactions. The adoption of these standards\\nwas applied for the entire reporting period unless otherwise stated. These new pronouncements have had no\\nsignificant impact on the group for this reporting period.\\nNew and revised standards that are effective for these financial statements\\nA number of new and revised standards became mandatory and are effective for annual periods beginning on\\nor after 1 January 2015.  Information on these new standards which could impact on the Group are presented\\nbelow:\\nAASB 2012-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial \\nLiabilities\\nAASB 2012-3 adds application guidance to AASB 132 to address inconsistencies identified in applying some of\\nthe offsetting criteria of AASB 132, including clarifying the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right\\nof set-off” and that some gross settlement systems may be considered equivalent to net settlement. \\n24\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nAASB 2012-3 is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.\\nThe adoption of these amendments has not had a material impact on the Group as the amendments merely\\nclarify the existing requirements in AASB 132. \\nAASB 2013-3 Amendments to AASB 136 – Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets\\nThese narrow-scope amendments address disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired\\nassets if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal.\\nWhen developing IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, the IASB decided to amend IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to\\nrequire disclosures about the recoverable amount of impaired assets.  The IASB noticed however that some of\\nthe amendments made in introducing those requirements resulted in the requirement being more broadly \\napplicable than the IASB had intended.  These amendments to IAS 36 therefore clarifies the IASB’s original \\nintention that the scope of those disclosures is limited to the recoverable amount of impaired assets that is\\nbased on fair value less costs of disposal. \\nAASB 2013-3 makes the equivalent amendments to AASB 136 Impairment of Assets and is applicable to annual\\nreporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.\\nThe adoption of these amendments has not had a material impact on the Group as they are largely of the \\nnature of clarification of existing requirements.\\nAASB 2014-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards (Part A: Annual Improvements 2010–2012 and\\n2011–2013 Cycles)\\nPart A of AASB 2014-1 makes amendments to various Australian Accounting Standards arising from the \\nissuance by the IASB of International Financial Reporting Standards Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012\\nCycle and Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle.\\nAmong other improvements, the amendments arising from Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle:\\n• clarify that the definition of a ‘related party’ includes a management entity that provides key management\\npersonnel services to the reporting entity (either directly or through a group entity); and\\n• amend AASB 8 Operating Segments to explicitly require the disclosure of judgements made by management\\nin applying the aggregation criteria.\\nAmong other improvements, the amendments arising from Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle \\nclarify that an entity should assess whether an acquired property is an investment property under AASB 140 \\nInvestment Property and perform a separate assessment under AASB 3 Business Combinations to determine\\nwhether the acquisition of the investment property constitutes a business combination.\\nPart A of AASB 2014-1 is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014.\\nThe adoption of these amendments has not had a material impact on the Group as they are largely of the \\nnature of clarification of existing requirements.\\n(v) New accounting standards for Application in Future Periods\\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for \\n28 February 2016 reporting periods and have not yet been applied in the financial report. Jupiter’s assessment\\nof the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below:\\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments\\nAASB 9 introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.\\nThese requirements improve and simplify the approach for classification and measurement of financial assets\\ncompared with the requirements of AASB 139. The main changes are:\\n(a) Financial assets that are debt instruments will be classified based on (1) the objective of the entity’s business\\nmodel for managing the financial assets; and (2) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.\\n25\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n(b) Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present gains and losses on investments in equity \\ninstruments that are not held for trading in other comprehensive income (instead of in profit or loss). Dividends\\nin respect of these investments that are a return on investment can be recognised in profit or loss and there is\\nno impairment or recycling on disposal of the instrument.\\n(c) Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if\\ndoing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from\\nmeasuring assets or liabilities, or recognising the gains and losses on them, on different bases.\\n(d) Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities the change in fair value is to be accounted for as\\nfollows:\\n• The change attributable to changes in credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income (OCI); and\\n• The remaining change is presented in profit or loss.\\nIf this approach creates or enlarges an accounting mismatch in the profit or loss, the effect of the changes in\\ncredit risk are also presented in profit or loss.\\nOtherwise, the following requirements have generally been carried forward unchanged from AASB 139 into\\nAASB 9:\\n• Classification and measurement of financial liabilities; and\\n• Derecognition requirements for financial assets and liabilities.\\nConsequential amendments were also made to other standards as a result of AASB 9, introduced by AASB\\n2009-11 and superseded by AASB 2010-7 and AASB 2010-10.\\nAASB 2010-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards –Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets\\nThese amendments address the determination of deferred tax on investment property measured at fair value\\nand introduce a rebuttable presumption that deferred tax on investment property measured at fair value should\\nbe determined on the basis that the carrying amount will be recoverable through sale. The amendments also \\nincorporate AASB Interpretation 121 Income Taxes – Recovery of Revalued Non-Depreciable Assets into AASB\\n112. This may not have an impact on the group, dependent upon any possible property transactions undertaken.\\nAASB 2014-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in\\nJoint Operations\\nThese amendments impacts on the use of AASB 11 when acquiring an interest in a joint operation.  \\nThe effective date is annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.\\nWhen these amendments are first adopted for the year ending 31 December 2016, there will be no material \\nimpact on the transactions and balances recognised in the financial statements.\\nAASB 2014-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an\\nInvestor and its Associate or Joint Venture\\nThe amendments address a current inconsistency between AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and\\nAASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011). The amendments clarify that, on a sale or \\ncontribution of assets to a joint venture or associate or on a loss of control when joint control or significant \\ninfluence is retained in a transaction involving an associate or a joint venture, any gain or loss recognised will \\ndepend on whether the assets or subsidiary constitute a business, as defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations.\\nFull gain or loss is recognised when the assets or subsidiary constitute a business, whereas gain or loss \\nattributable to other investors’ interests is recognised when the assets or subsidiary do not constitute a \\nbusiness.\\nThe effective date is for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.\\n26\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nWhen these amendments are first adopted for the year ending 31 December 2016, there will be no material \\nimpact on the financial statements.\\nThis Standard amends IFRS 9 to require application for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015,\\nrather than 1 January 2013. Early application of IFRS 9 is still permitted. IFRS 9 is also amended so that it does\\nnot require the restatement of comparative-period financial statements for the initial application of the \\nclassification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9, but instead requires modified disclosures on transition\\nto IFRS 9.\\nAASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\\nAASB 15 replaces AASB 118 Revenue, AASB 111 Construction Contracts and some revenue-related \\nInterpretations:\\n• establishes a new revenue recognition model\\n• changes the basis for deciding whether revenue is to be recognised over time or at a point in time\\n• provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics (e.g. multiple element arrangements, variable\\npricing, rights of return, warranties and licensing)\\n• expands and improves disclosures about revenue\\nThe effective date is for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.\\nThe entity is yet to undertake a detailed assessment of the impact of AASB 15.  However, based on the entity’s\\npreliminary assessment, the Standard is not expected to have a material impact on the transactions and bal-\\nances recognised in the financial statements when it is first adopted for the year ending 28 February 2018.\\nAASB 16 Leases\\nAASB 16:\\n• replaces AASB 117 Leases and some lease-related Interpretations\\n• requires all leases to be accounted for “on-balance sheet” by lessees, other than short-term and low value\\nasset leases\\n• provides new guidance on the application of the definition of lease and on sale and lease back accounting\\n• largely retains the existing lessor accounting requirements in AASB 117\\n• requires new and different disclosures about leases\\nThe effective date is for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.\\nWhen this Standard is first adopted for the year ending 28 February 2019, there will be no material impact on\\nthe transactions and balances recognised in the financial statements.\\nNote 2: Revenue\\nConsolidated Group\\nFebruary 2017 February 2016\\n$ $\\nSales revenue 155,555,500 -\\nCost of sales (146,298,513) -\\nGross Profit 9,256,987 -\\nInterest received 1,250,140 1,047,578\\nOther revenue 1,438,072 904,731\\nOther Income 2,688,212 1,952,309\\nDuring the financial year, Jupiter Kalahari S.A. gave notice to exit the OM Tshipi (S) Pte Ltd joint venture, which \\npreviously marketed and sold all the ore produced from Tshipi, and accordingly appointed Jupiter as its permitted\\nnominee to purchase its 49.9% share of the ore produced from Tshipi.

Non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting period to determine whether there is\\nan indication of impairment.\\nWhen indicators of impairment exist, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made. For the year-end, the\\nGroup commissioned an independent valuation of its 49.9% share of its investment in Tshipi é Ntle Manganese \\nMining Proprietary Limited (“Tshipi’). The valuation, which also included a Competent Persons Report, \\nrecommended a preferred valuation of the Tshipi Borwa asset to be $889,156,478. The Board therefore resolved to\\nreverse the investment in Tshipi of $143,643,903 that was recorded in the 2016 financial year.\\nUnder the equity method accounting standards however, an investment of this type is unable to be recognised at a\\nfair value higher than previously recognised. Therefore the carrying value of the Tshipi investment at year end is\\n$345,556,557, taking into account the reversal of the previous impairment, movement of shareholder loans, and \\naccumulated share of profit. \\nFurther details relating to the valuation and reversal of the impairment are as follows:\\na) Methodology\\nImpairment is recognised when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount\\nbeing the value in use of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) has been estimated using the discounted cash flows\\nmethod based on the Group’s recoverable minerals.\\nValue in use is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market based commodity price, estimated \\nquantities of recoverable minerals, production levels, operating costs and capital requirements. When Life of Mine\\n(LOM) plans fully utilise the existing mineral resource and the Group have demonstrated an ability to replenish \\nresources, an estimated replenishment rate has been applied to unmined resources.\\nThe estimates in the value in use calculation are considered to be level 3 measurements as they are derived from\\nvaluation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data. The Group considers the \\ninputs and the valuation approach to be consistent with the approach taken by similar market participants.\\nEstimates of quantities of recoverable minerals, production levels, operating costs and capital requirements are\\nsourced from the Group planning and budgeting process, capacity levels and mining plans for the following year.\\nThe 2018 budget and mine plan were developed in the context of the current manganese price environment.\\n37\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 18: Investments Using the Equity Method (continued)\\nSignificant judgements and assumptions are made by the Group to determine value in use. This includes assessing\\nvariable key assumptions such as manganese market prices, cost structures, production utilisation and capacity,\\navailable minerals and discount rates. Any change in these variable assumptions can cause adverse changes in one\\nor more of the assumptions used to estimate value in use.\\nFurther to the above, and the recovery of the manganese price market, the Board have resolved to reverse the 2016\\nimpairment in Tshipi of $143,643,903.\\nb) Key Assumptions\\nCommodity prices\\nThe Tshipi Borwa valuation is particularly sensitive to the manganese price. The independent valuation used \\ninformation from a range of sources to forecast the manganese price. The manganese price assumptions used were\\nwithin a range of US$2.60 per dry metric tonne unit (“dmtu”) to US$5.00 per dmtu over the life of mine.\\nDiscount rate\\nThe future cash flows of the CGU are discounted by the estimated real after tax weighted average cost of capital\\n(WACC), pursuant to the Capital Asset Pricing Model. This has been estimated based on the Tshipi WACC rate as\\nthe Tshipi mining operation is the Group’s primary asset.\\nProduction activity and operating and capital costs\\nLife of mine production activity and operating and capital cost assumptions are based on the Group’s latest budget,\\nincluding the five year budget and separately estimated LOM plan. Discounted cash flows include expected cost \\nimprovements and sustaining capital requirements. Estimated production is assumed consistent with the capacity\\nof the Tshipi mine taken into account while assuming a constant recovery rate.\\nResources and reserves\\nResource and Reserve tonnes were based on JORC 2012.\\nNote 19: Current liabilities – Trade and other payables\\nConsolidated Group\\nFebruary 2017 February 2016\\n$ $\\nCURRENT\\nUnsecured liabilities\\nTrade payables 133,949 8,287\\nSundry payables and accrued expenses 3,383,058 418,159\\n3,517,007 426,446\\nFair Value: Due to the short term nature of these payables, their carrying value is assumed to approximate to their\\nfair value.\\n38\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 20: Current and non-current provisions\\nConsolidated Group\\nFebruary 2017 February 2016\\n$ $\\nSHORT-TERM PROVISIONS\\nShort-term employee benefits 18,972 42,879\\nNote 21: Issued capital\\nPaid up capital:\\n2,281,835,383 (2016: 2,281,835,383) \\nfully paid ordinary shares 21(a) 526,639,293 526,639,293\\n(a) Ordinary shares\\nAt the beginning of the reporting period 526,639,293 526,639,293\\nAt reporting date 526,639,293 526,639,293\\nOrdinary shares participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the parent entity in proportion to the\\nnumber of shares held.\\nAt the shareholders meetings each ordinary share is entitled to one vote when a poll is called, otherwise each \\nshareholder has one vote on a show of hands.\\nThe ordinary shares have no par value.\\nConsolidated Group\\nFebruary 2017 February 2016\\nNumber of Shares Number of Shares\\nAt the beginning of the reporting period 2,281,835,383 2,281,835,383\\nAt reporting date 2,281,835,383 2,281,835,383\\n(b)   Capital Management\\nManagement controls the capital of the Group in order to maintain an appropriate debt to equity ratio, provide the\\nshareholders with adequate returns and ensure that the Group can fund its operations and continue as a going \\nconcern.\\nThe Group’s debt and capital includes ordinary share capital and financial liabilities, supported by financial assets.\\nThere are no externally imposed capital requirements.\\nManagement effectively manages the Group’s capital by assessing the Group’s financial risks and adjusting its \\ncapital structure in response to changes in these risks and in the market.

Such monitoring is used in \\nassessing receivables for impairment.\\nRisk is also minimised through investing surplus funds in financial institutions that maintain a high credit rating, or in\\nentities that the Directors have otherwise cleared as being financially sound.\\nCredit Risk Exposures\\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial assets at reporting date, excluding the value\\nof any collateral or other security held, is equivalent to the carrying value and classification of those financial assets\\n(net of any provisions) as presented in the statement of financial position. Credit risk also arises through the \\nprovision of financial guarantees, as approved at Board level, given to parties securing the liabilities of certain \\nsubsidiaries (refer Note 24 for details).\\nTrade and other receivables that are neither past due or impaired are considered to be of high credit quality. \\nAggregates of such amounts are as detailed in Note 10.\\nThere are no amounts of collateral held as security in respect of trade and other receivables.\\nThe Group does not have any material credit risk exposure to any single receivable or group of receivables under \\nfinancial instruments entered into by the Consolidated Group.\\nCredit risk related to balances with banks and other financial institutions is managed by investing cash with major \\nfinancial institutions in both cash on deposit and term deposit accounts. Interest rates on major deposits that are \\nre-invested are at a fixed rate on a monthly basis.\\n(b)  Liquidity risk\\nLiquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Group might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise\\nmeeting its obligations related to financial liabilities. The Group manages this risk through the following \\nmechanisms:\\n– preparing forward looking cash flow  analysis in relation to its operational, investing and financing activities;\\n– monitoring undrawn credit facilities;\\n– obtaining funding from a variety of sources;\\n– maintaining a reputable credit profile;\\n– managing credit risk related to financial assets;\\n– only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions; and comparing the maturity profile of financial \\nliabilities with the realisation profile of financial assets.\\nThe Group has no significant exposure to liquidity risk due to the level of cash and cash equivalents detailed at Note\\n9. The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring immediate and forecast cash requirements and ensuring \\nadequate cash reserves are maintained.\\nThe tables below reflect an undiscounted contractual maturity analysis for financial liabilities. Cash flows realised\\nfrom financial assets reflect management’s expectation as to the timing of realisation. Actual timing may therefore\\ndiffer from that disclosed. The timing of cash flows presented in the table to settle financial liabilities reflects the\\nearliest contractual settlement dates.\\n46\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 29: Financial Instruments (continued)\\nWithin 1 Year 1 to 5 Years Over 5 Years Total\\n2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016\\n$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $\\nConsolidated Group\\nFinancial liabilities due \\nfor payment\\nTrade and other \\npayables 3,517,007 426,446 - - - - 3,517,007 426,446\\nTotal expected \\noutflows 3,517,007 426,446 - - - - 3,517,007 426,446\\nFinancial assets – \\ncash flows realisable\\nCash and cash \\nequivalents 84,709,260 37,369,518 - - - -84,709,260 37,369,518\\nTrade and other \\nreceivables 9,956,038 239,663 - - - - 9,956,038 239,663\\nAssets held or \\navailable for sale 387,294 206,706 - - - - 387,294 206,706\\nOther current assets 26,278,632 - - - - 26,278,632 -\\nOther non-current \\nassets - - - 44,199,366 - - - 44,199,366\\nTotal anticipated \\ninflows 121,331,224 37,815,887 - 44,199,366 - - 121,331,224 82,015,253\\nNet (outflow)/\\ninflow on financial \\ninstruments 117,814,217 37,389,441 -44,199,366 - - 117,814,21781,588,807\\n(c) Market Risk\\nMarket risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the\\nrisk that the fair value of future cash flows  of a of a financial instrument will fluctuate because  of changes  in\\ninterest rates (interest rate risk), foreign exchange (currency risk) or other market factors (other price  risk).\\n(i) Interest rate risk\\nExposure to interest rate risk arises on financial assets and financial liabilities recognised at the end of the\\nreporting period whereby a future change  in interest rates will affect future cash flows  or the fair value of\\nfixed  rate financial instruments.

Jupiter’s exposure to currency risk is on\\ncash, trade receivables, and borrowings. Foreign currency risk is the risk of exposure to transactions that are \\ndenominated in a currency other than the Australian dollar. The carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets\\nand liabilities are denominated in two different currencies as set out below:\\n28 February 2017\\nAUD ZAR EUR USD Total $\\nFinancial Assets 20,758,232 2,389 27,591 63,921,048 84,709,260\\nOther Current Assets - 26,278,632 - - 26,278,632\\n(iii)  Other price risk\\nPrice risk relates to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of\\nchanges in market prices largely due to demand and supply factors for commodities. As the Group does not derive\\nrevenue from sale of products, the effect on profit and equity as a result of changes in the price risk is not \\nconsidered material. The fair value of the mining projects will be impacted by commodity price changes \\n(predominantly iron ore, nickel and uranium) and could impact future revenues once operational. However, \\nmanagement monitors current and projected commodity prices.\\n(iv)  Summarised sensitivity analysis\\nThe following table summarises the sensitivity of the Jupiter Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities to \\ninterest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.\\nManagement have reviewed interest rate and foreign exchange risk and determined the rates applied to be \\nappropriate.\\nInterest Rate Risk Foreign Exchange Risk\\n-50 bps +50 bps -10% +10%\\n28 February  Carrying Profit $ Other Profit $ Other Profit $ Other Profit $ Other\\n2017 Amount $ Equity$ Equity $ Equity $ Equity $\\nFinancial \\nAssets\\nCash and cash \\nequivalents - - - - -\\nCash and cash \\nequivalents 84,709,260 (42,355) 42,355 - - - - -\\nReceivables 9,956,038 - - - - - - - -\\nAvailable-for-sale \\nfinancial assets 387,294 - - - - - - - -\\nOther current \\nassets 26,278,632 (13,139) - 13,139 - - - - -\\nFinancial \\nLiabilities\\nTrade and \\nother payables 3,517,007 - - - - - - - -\\nTotal increase/\\n(decrease) (55,494) - 55,494 - - - - -\\n48\\nJUPITER MINES LIMITED 2017 ANNUAL REPORTNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017\\nNote 29: Financial Instruments (continued)\\n(v) Fixed Interest Rate Maturing\\nWAEIR Floating Interest Rate Within Year 1 to 5 Years Over 5 Years Non-Interest Bearing Total\\n2017 2016  2017 2016  2017  2016  2017  2016  2017  2016  2017 2016  2017 2016 \\n% % $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $\\nFinancial Assets:\\nCash and \\nDeposits 0.14 2.79 84,610,200 668,435 99,060 36,701,083 - - - - - - 84,709,26037,369,518\\nReceivables - - - - - - - - - - 9,956,038 239,663 9,956,038 239,663\\nOther Financial \\nAssets - - - - - - - - - - 387,294 206,706 387,294 206,706\\nOther Current \\nAssets - - - - - - - - - -26,278,632 - 26,278,632 -\\nOther Non-\\nCurrent Assets - - - - - - - - - - - 44,199,366 -44,199,366\\nTotal Financial \\nAssets 84,610,200 668,435 99,060 36,701,083 - - - -36,621,964 44,645,735 121,331,22482,015,253\\nFinancial Liabilities:\\nTrade and \\nsundry payables - - - - - - - - - - 3,517,007 426,446 3,517,007 426,446\\nTotal Financial \\nLiabilities - - - - - - - - 3,517,007 426,446 3,517,007 426,446\\nWAEIR = Weighted Average Effective Interest Rate\\n(d) Net Fair Value\\nThe net fair values of cash and cash equivalents and non-interest bearing monetary financial assets and \\nliabilities approximates their carrying value.

Two households, both alike in dignity,\\r\\n    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,\\r\\n    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\\r\\n    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\\r\\n    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes\\r\\n    A pair of star-cross\\'d lovers take their life;\\r\\n    Whose misadventur\\'d piteous overthrows\\r\\n    Doth with their death bury their parents\\' strife.\\r\\n    The fearful passage of their death-mark\\'d love,\\r\\n    And the continuance of their parents\\' rage,\\r\\n    Which, but their children\\'s end, naught could remove,\\r\\n    Is now the two hours\\' traffic of our stage;\\r\\n    The which if you with patient ears attend,\\r\\n    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.\\r\\n                                                         [Exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT I. Scene I.\\r\\nVerona. A public place.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house\\r\\nof Capulet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we\\'ll not carry coals.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we\\'ll draw.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.\\r\\n    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn\\'st away.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take\\r\\n    the wall of any man or maid of Montague\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the\\r\\n    wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. \\'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\\r\\n    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague\\'s men\\r\\n    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. \\'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have\\r\\n    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off\\r\\n    their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. The heads of the maids?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\\r\\n    Take it in what sense thou wilt.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and \\'tis known I\\r\\n    am a pretty piece of flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. \\'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst\\r\\n    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of\\r\\n    Montagues.\\r\\n\\r\\n           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. Fear me not.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is\\r\\n    disgrace to them, if they bear it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my\\r\\n    thumb, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as\\r\\n    you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Abr. No better.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. Well, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter Benvolio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say \\'better.\\' Here comes one of my\\r\\n    master\\'s kinsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. Yes, better, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Abr. You lie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.\\r\\n                                                     They fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]\\r\\n    Put up your swords. You know not what you do.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Enter Tybalt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\\r\\n    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,\\r\\n    Or manage it to part these men with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\\r\\n    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.\\r\\n    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or\\r\\n                          partisans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\\r\\n\\r\\n           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come\\r\\n    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.\\r\\n\\r\\n  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\\r\\n    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-\\r\\n    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,\\r\\n    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\r\\n    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!\\r\\n    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\r\\n    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground\\r\\n    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.\\r\\n    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word\\r\\n    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\r\\n    Have thrice disturb\\'d the quiet of our streets\\r\\n    And made Verona\\'s ancient citizens\\r\\n    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments\\r\\n    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\r\\n    Cank\\'red with peace, to part your cank\\'red hate.\\r\\n    If ever you disturb our streets again,\\r\\n    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\\r\\n    For this time all the rest depart away.\\r\\n    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;\\r\\n    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,\\r\\n    To know our farther pleasure in this case,\\r\\n    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.\\r\\n    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.\\r\\n              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\r\\n    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary\\r\\n    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\r\\n    I drew to part them. In the instant came\\r\\n    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar\\'d;\\r\\n    Which, as he breath\\'d defiance to my ears,\\r\\n    He swung about his head and cut the winds,\\r\\n    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss\\'d him in scorn.\\r\\n    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\\r\\n    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\\r\\n    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.\\r\\n\\r\\n  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?\\r\\n    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp\\'d sun\\r\\n    Peer\\'d forth the golden window of the East,\\r\\n    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\\r\\n    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore\\r\\n    That westward rooteth from the city\\'s side,\\r\\n    So early walking did I see your son.\\r\\n    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me\\r\\n    And stole into the covert of the wood.\\r\\n    I- measuring his affections by my own,\\r\\n    Which then most sought where most might not be found,\\r\\n    Being one too many by my weary self-\\r\\n    Pursu\\'d my humour, not Pursuing his,\\r\\n    And gladly shunn\\'d who gladly fled from me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,\\r\\n    With tears augmenting the fresh morning\\'s dew,\\r\\n    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\r\\n    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\r\\n    Should in the furthest East bean to draw\\r\\n    The shady curtains from Aurora\\'s bed,\\r\\n    Away from light steals home my heavy son\\r\\n    And private in his chamber pens himself,\\r\\n    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight\\r\\n    And makes himself an artificial night.\\r\\n    Black and portentous must this humour prove\\r\\n    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Have you importun\\'d him by any means?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;\\r\\n    But he, his own affections\\' counsellor,\\r\\n    Is to himself- I will not say how true-\\r\\n    But to himself so secret and so close,\\r\\n    So far from sounding and discovery,\\r\\n    As is the bud bit with an envious worm\\r\\n    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\\r\\n    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\r\\n    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\r\\n    We would as willingly give cure as know.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,\\r\\n    I\\'ll know his grievance, or be much denied.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\r\\n    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let\\'s away,\\r\\n                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Is the day so young?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. But new struck nine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.\\r\\n    Was that my father that went hence so fast?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo\\'s hours?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. In love?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Out-\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Of love?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,\\r\\n    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,\\r\\n    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!\\r\\n    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\\r\\n    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\\r\\n    Here\\'s much to do with hate, but more with love.\\r\\n    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\r\\n    O anything, of nothing first create!\\r\\n    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\r\\n    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\r\\n    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\r\\n    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is\\r\\n    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\r\\n    Dost thou not laugh?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Good heart, at what?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. At thy good heart\\'s oppression.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Why, such is love\\'s transgression.\\r\\n    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\r\\n    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\\r\\n    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\\r\\n    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\r\\n    Love is a smoke rais\\'d with the fume of sighs;\\r\\n    Being purg\\'d, a fire sparkling in lovers\\' eyes;\\r\\n    Being vex\\'d, a sea nourish\\'d with lovers\\' tears.\\r\\n    What is it else? A madness most discreet,\\r\\n    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\r\\n    Farewell, my coz.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Soft! I will go along.\\r\\n    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:\\r\\n    This is not Romeo, he\\'s some other where.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Groan? Why, no;\\r\\n    But sadly tell me who.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.\\r\\n    Ah, word ill urg\\'d to one that is so ill!\\r\\n    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. I aim\\'d so near when I suppos\\'d you lov\\'d.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. A right good markman! And she\\'s fair I love.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She\\'ll not be hit\\r\\n    With Cupid\\'s arrow. She hath Dian\\'s wit,\\r\\n    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm\\'d,\\r\\n    From Love\\'s weak childish bow she lives unharm\\'d.\\r\\n    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,\\r\\n    Nor bide th\\' encounter of assailing eyes,\\r\\n    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\\r\\n    O, she\\'s rich in beauty; only poor\\r\\n    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\r\\n    For beauty, starv\\'d with her severity,\\r\\n    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\\r\\n    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\\r\\n    To merit bliss by making me despair.\\r\\n    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\\r\\n    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Be rul\\'d by me: forget to think of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.\\r\\n    Examine other beauties.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. \\'Tis the way\\r\\n    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.\\r\\n    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies\\' brows,\\r\\n    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.\\r\\n    He that is strucken blind cannot forget\\r\\n    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\\r\\n    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\\r\\n    What doth her beauty serve but as a note\\r\\n    Where I may read who pass\\'d that passing fair?\\r\\n    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. I\\'ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene II.\\r\\nA Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,\\r\\n    In penalty alike; and \\'tis not hard, I think,\\r\\n    For men so old as we to keep the peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,\\r\\n    And pity \\'tis you liv\\'d at odds so long.\\r\\n    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. But saying o\\'er what I have said before:\\r\\n    My child is yet a stranger in the world,\\r\\n    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\\r\\n    Let two more summers wither in their pride\\r\\n    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. And too soon marr\\'d are those so early made.\\r\\n    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;\\r\\n    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.\\r\\n    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;\\r\\n    My will to her consent is but a part.\\r\\n    An she agree, within her scope of choice\\r\\n    Lies my consent and fair according voice.\\r\\n    This night I hold an old accustom\\'d feast,\\r\\n    Whereto I have invited many a guest,\\r\\n    Such as I love; and you among the store,\\r\\n    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\\r\\n    At my poor house look to behold this night\\r\\n    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\\r\\n    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel\\r\\n    When well apparell\\'d April on the heel\\r\\n    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight\\r\\n    Among fresh female buds shall you this night\\r\\n    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\\r\\n    And like her most whose merit most shall be;\\r\\n    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,\\r\\n    May stand in number, though in reck\\'ning none.\\r\\n    Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,\\r\\n    sirrah, trudge about\\r\\n    Through fair Verona; find those persons out\\r\\n    Whose names are written there, and to them say,\\r\\n    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-\\r\\n                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].\\r\\n\\r\\n  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written\\r\\n    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor\\r\\n    with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter\\r\\n    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are\\r\\n    here writ, and can never find what names the writing person\\r\\n    hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!\\r\\n\\r\\n                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another\\'s burning;\\r\\n    One pain is lessoned by another\\'s anguish;\\r\\n    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\\r\\n    One desperate grief cures with another\\'s languish.\\r\\n    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,\\r\\n    And the rank poison of the old will die.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. For what, I pray thee?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. For your broken shin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;\\r\\n    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,\\r\\n    Whipp\\'d and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Serv. God gi\\' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book.

My master\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Indeed I should have ask\\'d you that before.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Serv. Now I\\'ll tell you without asking.

Call her forth to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,\\r\\n    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!\\r\\n    God forbid! Where\\'s this girl? What, Juliet!\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. How now? Who calls?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Your mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Madam, I am here.\\r\\n    What is your will?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,\\r\\n    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;\\r\\n    I have rememb\\'red me, thou\\'s hear our counsel.\\r\\n    Thou knowest my daughter\\'s of a pretty age.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. She\\'s not fourteen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. I\\'ll lay fourteen of my teeth-\\r\\n    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-\\r\\n    She is not fourteen. How long is it now\\r\\n    To Lammastide?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,\\r\\n    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\\r\\n    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\\r\\n    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\\r\\n    She was too good for me. But, as I said,\\r\\n    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\\r\\n    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\\r\\n    \\'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\\r\\n    And she was wean\\'d (I never shall forget it),\\r\\n    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;\\r\\n    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\\r\\n    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\\r\\n    My lord and you were then at Mantua.\\r\\n    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\\r\\n    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\\r\\n    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\\r\\n    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\\r\\n    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! \\'Twas no need, I trow,\\r\\n    To bid me trudge.\\r\\n    And since that time it is eleven years,\\r\\n    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th\\' rood,\\r\\n    She could have run and waddled all about;\\r\\n    For even the day before, she broke her brow;\\r\\n    And then my husband (God be with his soul!\\r\\n    \\'A was a merry man) took up the child.\\r\\n    \\'Yea,\\' quoth he, \\'dost thou fall upon thy face?\\r\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\\r\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' and, by my holidam,\\r\\n    The pretty wretch left crying, and said \\'Ay.\\'\\r\\n    To see now how a jest shall come about!\\r\\n    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,\\r\\n    I never should forget it. \\'Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' quoth he,\\r\\n    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said \\'Ay.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh\\r\\n    To think it should leave crying and say \\'Ay.\\'\\r\\n    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow\\r\\n    A bump as big as a young cock\\'rel\\'s stone;\\r\\n    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.\\r\\n    \\'Yea,\\' quoth my husband, \\'fall\\'st upon thy face?\\r\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\\r\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' It stinted, and said \\'Ay.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\\r\\n    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e\\'er I nurs\\'d.\\r\\n    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Marry, that \\'marry\\' is the very theme\\r\\n    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\\r\\n    How stands your disposition to be married?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,\\r\\n    I would say thou hadst suck\\'d wisdom from thy teat.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,\\r\\n    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\\r\\n    Are made already mothers. By my count,\\r\\n    I was your mother much upon these years\\r\\n    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\\r\\n    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man\\r\\n    As all the world- why he\\'s a man of wax.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Verona\\'s summer hath not such a flower.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Nay, he\\'s a flower, in faith- a very flower.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\\r\\n    This night you shall behold him at our feast.\\r\\n    Read o\\'er the volume of young Paris\\' face,\\r\\n    And find delight writ there with beauty\\'s pen;\\r\\n    Examine every married lineament,\\r\\n    And see how one another lends content;\\r\\n    And what obscur\\'d in this fair volume lies\\r\\n    Find written in the margent of his eyes,\\r\\n    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,\\r\\n    To beautify him only lacks a cover.\\r\\n    The fish lives in the sea, and \\'tis much pride\\r\\n    For fair without the fair within to hide.\\r\\n    That book in many\\'s eyes doth share the glory,\\r\\n    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\\r\\n    So shall you share all that he doth possess,\\r\\n    By having him making yourself no less.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris\\' love?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I\\'ll look to like, if looking liking move;\\r\\n    But no more deep will I endart mine eye\\r\\n    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter Servingman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Serv.

Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\\r\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene IV.\\r\\nA street.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;\\r\\nTorchbearers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\\r\\n    Or shall we on without apology?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.\\r\\n    We\\'ll have no Cupid hoodwink\\'d with a scarf,\\r\\n    Bearing a Tartar\\'s painted bow of lath,\\r\\n    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;\\r\\n    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\\r\\n    After the prompter, for our entrance;\\r\\n    But, let them measure us by what they will,\\r\\n    We\\'ll measure them a measure, and be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.\\r\\n    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\\r\\n    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead\\r\\n    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid\\'s wings\\r\\n    And soar with them above a common bound.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft\\r\\n    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound\\r\\n    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\\r\\n    Under love\\'s heavy burthen do I sink.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-\\r\\n    Too great oppression for a tender thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,\\r\\n    Too rude, too boist\\'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.\\r\\n    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\\r\\n    Give me a case to put my visage in.\\r\\n    A visor for a visor! What care I\\r\\n    What curious eye doth quote deformities?\\r\\n    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in\\r\\n    But every man betake him to his legs.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart\\r\\n    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\\r\\n    For I am proverb\\'d with a grandsire phrase,\\r\\n    I\\'ll be a candle-holder and look on;\\r\\n    The game was ne\\'er so fair, and I am done.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Tut! dun\\'s the mouse, the constable\\'s own word!\\r\\n    If thou art Dun, we\\'ll draw thee from the mire\\r\\n    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick\\'st\\r\\n    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Nay, that\\'s not so.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay\\r\\n    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\\r\\n    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\\r\\n    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;\\r\\n    But \\'tis no wit to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Why, may one ask?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. And so did I.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Well, what was yours?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. That dreamers often lie.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\\r\\n    She is the fairies\\' midwife, and she comes\\r\\n    In shape no bigger than an agate stone\\r\\n    On the forefinger of an alderman,\\r\\n    Drawn with a team of little atomies\\r\\n    Athwart men\\'s noses as they lie asleep;\\r\\n    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners\\' legs,\\r\\n    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\\r\\n    Her traces, of the smallest spider\\'s web;\\r\\n    Her collars, of the moonshine\\'s wat\\'ry beams;\\r\\n    Her whip, of cricket\\'s bone; the lash, of film;\\r\\n    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\\r\\n    Not half so big as a round little worm\\r\\n    Prick\\'d from the lazy finger of a maid;\\r\\n    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\\r\\n    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\\r\\n    Time out o\\' mind the fairies\\' coachmakers.\\r\\n    And in this state she \\'gallops night by night\\r\\n    Through lovers\\' brains, and then they dream of love;\\r\\n    O\\'er courtiers\\' knees, that dream on cursies straight;\\r\\n    O\\'er lawyers\\' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\\r\\n    O\\'er ladies\\' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\\r\\n    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\\r\\n    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\\r\\n    Sometime she gallops o\\'er a courtier\\'s nose,\\r\\n    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\\r\\n    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig\\'s tail\\r\\n    Tickling a parson\\'s nose as \\'a lies asleep,\\r\\n    Then dreams he of another benefice.\\r\\n    Sometimes she driveth o\\'er a soldier\\'s neck,\\r\\n    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\\r\\n    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\\r\\n    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon\\r\\n    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\\r\\n    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\\r\\n    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab\\r\\n    That plats the manes of horses in the night\\r\\n    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,\\r\\n    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes\\r\\n    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\\r\\n    That presses them and learns them first to bear,\\r\\n    Making them women of good carriage.\\r\\n    This is she-\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\\r\\n    Thou talk\\'st of nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;\\r\\n    Which are the children of an idle brain,\\r\\n    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;\\r\\n    Which is as thin of substance as the air,\\r\\n    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\\r\\n    Even now the frozen bosom of the North\\r\\n    And, being anger\\'d, puffs away from thence,\\r\\n    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\\r\\n    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives\\r\\n    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\\r\\n    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\\r\\n    With this night\\'s revels and expire the term\\r\\n    Of a despised life, clos\\'d in my breast,\\r\\n    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.\\r\\n    But he that hath the steerage of my course\\r\\n    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Strike, drum.\\r\\n                           They march about the stage.

When good manners shall lie all in one or two men\\'s\\r\\n    hands, and they unwash\\'d too, \\'tis a foul thing.\\r\\n  1. Serv.

[to a Servingman] What lady\\'s that, which doth enrich the\\r\\n    hand Of yonder knight?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Serv. I know not, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\\r\\n    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\\r\\n    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop\\'s ear-\\r\\n    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\\r\\n    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\\r\\n    As yonder lady o\\'er her fellows shows.\\r\\n    The measure done, I\\'ll watch her place of stand\\r\\n    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\\r\\n    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!\\r\\n    For I ne\\'er saw true beauty till this night.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.\\r\\n    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave\\r\\n    Come hither, cover\\'d with an antic face,\\r\\n    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\\r\\n    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,\\r\\n    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;\\r\\n    A villain, that is hither come in spite\\r\\n    To scorn at our solemnity this night.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Young Romeo is it?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. \\'Tis he, that villain Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.\\r\\n    \\'A bears him like a portly gentleman,\\r\\n    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him\\r\\n    To be a virtuous and well-govern\\'d youth.\\r\\n    I would not for the wealth of all this town\\r\\n    Here in my house do him disparagement.\\r\\n    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.\\r\\n    It is my will; the which if thou respect,\\r\\n    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,\\r\\n    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.\\r\\n    I\\'ll not endure him.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. He shall be endur\\'d.\\r\\n    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!\\r\\n    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!\\r\\n    You\\'ll not endure him?

Go to, go to!\\r\\n    You are a saucy boy. Is\\'t so, indeed?\\r\\n    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.\\r\\n    You must contrary me!

Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting\\r\\n    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\\r\\n    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,\\r\\n    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt\\'rest gall.

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\\r\\n    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;\\r\\n    For saints have hands that pilgrims\\' hands do touch,\\r\\n    And palm to palm is holy palmers\\' kiss.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom.

Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;\\r\\n    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.\\r\\n    Is it e\\'en so? Why then, I thank you all.\\r\\n    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.\\r\\n    More torches here!

My only love, sprung from my only hate!\\r\\n    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!\\r\\n    Prodigious birth of love it is to me\\r\\n    That I must love a loathed enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse.

Scene I.\\r\\nA lane by the wall of Capulet\\'s orchard.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Romeo alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?\\r\\n    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.\\r\\n                     [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]\\r\\n\\r\\n                   Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. He is wise,\\r\\n    And, on my life, hath stol\\'n him home to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.\\r\\n    Call, good Mercutio.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Nay, I\\'ll conjure too.\\r\\n    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!\\r\\n    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;\\r\\n    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!\\r\\n    Cry but \\'Ay me!\\' pronounce but \\'love\\' and \\'dove\\';\\r\\n    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,\\r\\n    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,\\r\\n    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim\\r\\n    When King Cophetua lov\\'d the beggar maid!\\r\\n    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;\\r\\n    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.\\r\\n    I conjure thee by Rosaline\\'s bright eyes.\\r\\n    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,\\r\\n    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,\\r\\n    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,\\r\\n    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. This cannot anger him. \\'Twould anger him\\r\\n    To raise a spirit in his mistress\\' circle\\r\\n    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand\\r\\n    Till she had laid it and conjur\\'d it down.\\r\\n    That were some spite; my invocation\\r\\n    Is fair and honest: in his mistress\\' name,\\r\\n    I conjure only but to raise up him.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees\\r\\n    To be consorted with the humorous night.\\r\\n    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.\\r\\n    Now will he sit under a medlar tree\\r\\n    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit\\r\\n    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.\\r\\n    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were\\r\\n    An open et cetera, thou a pop\\'rin pear!\\r\\n    Romeo, good night. I\\'ll to my truckle-bed;\\r\\n    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.\\r\\n    Come, shall we go?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Go then, for \\'tis in vain\\r\\n    \\'To seek him here that means not to be found.\\r\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene II.\\r\\nCapulet\\'s orchard.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.\\r\\n\\r\\n                     Enter Juliet above at a window.\\r\\n\\r\\n    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?\\r\\n    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!\\r\\n    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\\r\\n    Who is already sick and pale with grief\\r\\n    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.\\r\\n    Be not her maid, since she is envious.\\r\\n    Her vestal livery is but sick and green,\\r\\n    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.\\r\\n    It is my lady; O, it is my love!\\r\\n    O that she knew she were!\\r\\n    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\\r\\n    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.\\r\\n    I am too bold; \\'tis not to me she speaks.\\r\\n    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\\r\\n    Having some business, do entreat her eyes\\r\\n    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.\\r\\n    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?\\r\\n    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\\r\\n    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\\r\\n    Would through the airy region stream so bright\\r\\n    That birds would sing and think it were not night.\\r\\n    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\\r\\n    O that I were a glove upon that hand,\\r\\n    That I might touch that cheek!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Ay me!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. She speaks.\\r\\n    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\\r\\n    As glorious to this night, being o\\'er my head,\\r\\n    As is a winged messenger of heaven\\r\\n    Unto the white-upturned wond\\'ring eyes\\r\\n    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\\r\\n    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds\\r\\n    And sails upon the bosom of the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\\r\\n    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!\\r\\n    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\\r\\n    And I\\'ll no longer be a Capulet.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. \\'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\\r\\n    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\\r\\n    What\\'s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\\r\\n    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part\\r\\n    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!\\r\\n    What\\'s in a name? That which we call a rose\\r\\n    By any other name would smell as sweet.\\r\\n    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call\\'d,\\r\\n    Retain that dear perfection which he owes\\r\\n    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;\\r\\n    And for that name, which is no part of thee,\\r\\n    Take all myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I take thee at thy word.\\r\\n    Call me but love, and I\\'ll be new baptiz\\'d;\\r\\n    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen\\'d in night,\\r\\n    So stumblest on my counsel?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. By a name\\r\\n    I know not how to tell thee who I am.\\r\\n    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\\r\\n    Because it is an enemy to thee.\\r\\n    Had I it written, I would tear the word.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\\r\\n    Of that tongue\\'s utterance, yet I know the sound.\\r\\n    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. How cam\\'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\\r\\n    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\\r\\n    And the place death, considering who thou art,\\r\\n    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. With love\\'s light wings did I o\\'erperch these walls;\\r\\n    For stony limits cannot hold love out,\\r\\n    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.\\r\\n    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye\\r\\n    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,\\r\\n    And I am proof against their enmity.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I have night\\'s cloak to hide me from their sight;\\r\\n    And but thou love me, let them find me here.\\r\\n    My life were better ended by their hate\\r\\n    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. By whose direction found\\'st thou out this place?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.\\r\\n    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\\r\\n    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\\r\\n    As that vast shore wash\\'d with the farthest sea,\\r\\n    I would adventure for such merchandise.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;\\r\\n    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\\r\\n    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.\\r\\n    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny\\r\\n    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!\\r\\n    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say \\'Ay\\';\\r\\n    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear\\'st,\\r\\n    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers\\' perjuries,\\r\\n    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\\r\\n    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\\r\\n    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\\r\\n    I\\'ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\\r\\n    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\\r\\n    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\\r\\n    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;\\r\\n    But trust me, gentleman, I\\'ll prove more true\\r\\n    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.\\r\\n    I should have been more strange, I must confess,\\r\\n    But that thou overheard\\'st, ere I was ware,\\r\\n    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,\\r\\n    And not impute this yielding to light love,\\r\\n    Which the dark night hath so discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,\\r\\n    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th\\' inconstant moon,\\r\\n    That monthly changes in her circled orb,\\r\\n    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. What shall I swear by?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Do not swear at all;\\r\\n    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\\r\\n    Which is the god of my idolatry,\\r\\n    And I\\'ll believe thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. If my heart\\'s dear love-\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\\r\\n    I have no joy of this contract to-night.\\r\\n    It is too rash, too unadvis\\'d, too sudden;\\r\\n    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be\\r\\n    Ere one can say \\'It lightens.\\' Sweet, good night!\\r\\n    This bud of love, by summer\\'s ripening breath,\\r\\n    May prove a beauteous flow\\'r when next we meet.\\r\\n    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest\\r\\n    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Th\\' exchange of thy love\\'s faithful vow for mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\\r\\n    And yet I would it were to give again.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Would\\'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.\\r\\n    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.\\r\\n    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,\\r\\n    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,\\r\\n    The more I have, for both are infinite.\\r\\n    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!\\r\\n                                           [Nurse] calls within.\\r\\n    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\\r\\n    Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,\\r\\n    Being in night, all this is but a dream,\\r\\n    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter Juliet above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\\r\\n    If that thy bent of love be honourable,\\r\\n    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\\r\\n    By one that I\\'ll procure to come to thee,\\r\\n    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\\r\\n    And all my fortunes at thy foot I\\'ll lay\\r\\n    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. (within) Madam!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,\\r\\n    I do beseech thee-\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. (within) Madam!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. By-and-by I come.-\\r\\n    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.\\r\\n    To-morrow will I send.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. So thrive my soul-\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!\\r\\n    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;\\r\\n    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\\r\\n\\r\\n                     Enter Juliet again, [above].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer\\'s voice\\r\\n    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!\\r\\n    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;\\r\\n    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\\r\\n    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\\r\\n    With repetition of my Romeo\\'s name.\\r\\n    Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.\\r\\n    How silver-sweet sound lovers\\' tongues by night,\\r\\n    Like softest music to attending ears!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. My dear?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. At what o\\'clock to-morrow\\r\\n    Shall I send to thee?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. By the hour of nine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I will not fail. \\'Tis twenty years till then.\\r\\n    I have forgot why I did call thee back.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\\r\\n    Rememb\\'ring how I love thy company.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. And I\\'ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\\r\\n    Forgetting any other home but this.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. \\'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-\\r\\n    And yet no farther than a wanton\\'s bird,\\r\\n    That lets it hop a little from her hand,\\r\\n    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\\r\\n    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,\\r\\n    So loving-jealous of his liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I would I were thy bird.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Sweet, so would I.\\r\\n    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\\r\\n    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,\\r\\n    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.\\r\\n                                                         [Exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!\\r\\n    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!\\r\\n    Hence will I to my ghostly father\\'s cell,\\r\\n    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\\r\\n Exit\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene III.\\r\\nFriar Laurence\\'s cell.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. The grey-ey\\'d morn smiles on the frowning night,\\r\\n    Check\\'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;\\r\\n    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels\\r\\n    From forth day\\'s path and Titan\\'s fiery wheels.\\r\\n    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye\\r\\n    The day to cheer and night\\'s dank dew to dry,\\r\\n    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours\\r\\n    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\\r\\n    The earth that\\'s nature\\'s mother is her tomb.\\r\\n    What is her burying gave, that is her womb;\\r\\n    And from her womb children of divers kind\\r\\n    We sucking on her natural bosom find;\\r\\n    Many for many virtues excellent,\\r\\n    None but for some, and yet all different.\\r\\n    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\\r\\n    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;\\r\\n    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live\\r\\n    But to the earth some special good doth give;\\r\\n    Nor aught so good but, strain\\'d from that fair use,\\r\\n    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\\r\\n    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,\\r\\n    And vice sometime\\'s by action dignified.\\r\\n    Within the infant rind of this small flower\\r\\n    Poison hath residence, and medicine power;\\r\\n    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\\r\\n    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\\r\\n    Two such opposed kings encamp them still\\r\\n    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;\\r\\n    And where the worser is predominant,\\r\\n    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Good morrow, father.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Benedicite!\\r\\n    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\\r\\n    Young son, it argues a distempered head\\r\\n    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.\\r\\n    Care keeps his watch in every old man\\'s eye,\\r\\n    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;\\r\\n    But where unbruised youth with unstuff\\'d brain\\r\\n    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.\\r\\n    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure\\r\\n    Thou art uprous\\'d with some distemp\\'rature;\\r\\n    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-\\r\\n    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\\r\\n    I have forgot that name, and that name\\'s woe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. That\\'s my good son! But where hast thou been then?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I\\'ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\\r\\n    I have been feasting with mine enemy,\\r\\n    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me\\r\\n    That\\'s by me wounded. Both our remedies\\r\\n    Within thy help and holy physic lies.\\r\\n    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,\\r\\n    My intercession likewise steads my foe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift\\r\\n    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Then plainly know my heart\\'s dear love is set\\r\\n    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;\\r\\n    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,\\r\\n    And all combin\\'d, save what thou must combine\\r\\n    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how\\r\\n    We met, we woo\\'d, and made exchange of vow,\\r\\n    I\\'ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\\r\\n    That thou consent to marry us to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!\\r\\n    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\\r\\n    So soon forsaken? Young men\\'s love then lies\\r\\n    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\\r\\n    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine\\r\\n    Hath wash\\'d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\\r\\n    How much salt water thrown away in waste,\\r\\n    To season love, that of it doth not taste!\\r\\n    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\\r\\n    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.\\r\\n    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\\r\\n    Of an old tear that is not wash\\'d off yet.\\r\\n    If e\\'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\\r\\n    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.\\r\\n    And art thou chang\\'d? Pronounce this sentence then:\\r\\n    Women may fall when there\\'s no strength in men.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Thou chid\\'st me oft for loving Rosaline.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. And bad\\'st me bury love.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Not in a grave\\r\\n    To lay one in, another out to have.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now\\r\\n    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.\\r\\n    The other did not so.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. O, she knew well\\r\\n    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\\r\\n    But come, young waverer, come go with me.\\r\\n    In one respect I\\'ll thy assistant be;\\r\\n    For this alliance may so happy prove\\r\\n    To turn your households\\' rancour to pure love.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.\\r\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene IV.\\r\\nA street.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Benvolio and Mercutio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?\\r\\n    Came he not home to-night?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Not to his father\\'s. I spoke with his man.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,\\r\\n    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,\\r\\n    Hath sent a letter to his father\\'s house.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. A challenge, on my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Romeo will answer it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter\\'s master, how he dares,\\r\\n    being dared.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb\\'d with a white\\r\\n    wench\\'s black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the\\r\\n    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy\\'s\\r\\n    butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he\\'s the\\r\\n    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing\\r\\n    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his\\r\\n    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very\\r\\n    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman\\r\\n    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the\\r\\n    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. The what?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-\\r\\n    these new tuners of accent! \\'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very\\r\\n    tall man! a very good whore!\\' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,\\r\\n    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange\\r\\n    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi\\'s, who stand\\r\\n    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old\\r\\n    bench? O, their bones, their bones!\\r\\n\\r\\n                               Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how\\r\\n    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch\\r\\n    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she\\r\\n    had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,\\r\\n    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,\\r\\n    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There\\'s a French\\r\\n    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit\\r\\n    fairly last night.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a\\r\\n    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. That\\'s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a\\r\\n    man to bow in the hams.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. A most courteous exposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Pink for flower.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Right.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower\\'d.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out\\r\\n    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may\\r\\n    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I\\'ll cry a match.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for\\r\\n    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am\\r\\n    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not\\r\\n    there for the goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv\\'d in to a sweet goose?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. O, here\\'s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch\\r\\n    narrow to an ell broad!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I stretch it out for that word \\'broad,\\' which, added to\\r\\n    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now\\r\\n    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by\\r\\n    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a\\r\\n    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in\\r\\n    a hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Stop there, stop there!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. O, thou art deceiv\\'d! I would have made it short; for I\\r\\n    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to\\r\\n    occupy the argument no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Here\\'s goodly gear!\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. A sail, a sail!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Peter!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Peter. Anon.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. My fan, Peter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan\\'s the fairer face of\\r\\n    the two.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Is it good-den?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. \\'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is\\r\\n    now upon the prick of noon.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. \\'For himself to mar,\\'\\r\\n    quoth \\'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the\\r\\n    young Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you\\r\\n    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest\\r\\n    of that name, for fault of a worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. You say well.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i\\' faith! wisely,\\r\\n    wisely.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. What hast thou found?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is\\r\\n    something stale and hoar ere it be spent\\r\\n                                     He walks by them and sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n                   An old hare hoar,\\r\\n                   And an old hare hoar,\\r\\n                Is very good meat in Lent;\\r\\n                   But a hare that is hoar\\r\\n                   Is too much for a score\\r\\n                When it hoars ere it be spent.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Romeo, will you come to your father\\'s? We\\'ll to dinner thither.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I will follow you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,\\r\\n    [sings] lady, lady, lady.\\r\\n                                      Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant\\r\\n    was this that was so full of his ropery?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and\\r\\n    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. An \\'a speak anything against me, I\\'ll take him down, an\\r\\n\\'a\\r\\n    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,\\r\\n    I\\'ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his\\r\\n    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must\\r\\n    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my\\r\\n    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as\\r\\n    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the\\r\\n    law on my side.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me\\r\\n    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,\\r\\n    my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I\\r\\n    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead\\r\\n    her into a fool\\'s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of\\r\\n    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and\\r\\n    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were\\r\\n    an ill thing to be off\\'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\r\\n    thee-\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,\\r\\n    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I\\r\\n    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Bid her devise\\r\\n    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;\\r\\n    And there she shall at Friar Laurence\\' cell\\r\\n    Be shriv\\'d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\r\\n    Within this hour my man shall be with thee\\r\\n    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\r\\n    Which to the high topgallant of my joy\\r\\n    Must be my convoy in the secret night.\\r\\n    Farewell. Be trusty, and I\\'ll quit thy pains.\\r\\n    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. What say\\'st thou, my dear nurse?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne\\'er hear say,\\r\\n    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I warrant thee my man\\'s as true as steel.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!\\r\\n    when \\'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in\\r\\n    town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,\\r\\n    good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I\\r\\n    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;\\r\\n    but I\\'ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\\r\\n    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both\\r\\n    with a letter?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that\\'s the dog\\'s name. R is for the- No; I\\r\\n    know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest\\r\\n    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you\\r\\n    good to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Peter. Anon.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.\\r\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene V.\\r\\nCapulet\\'s orchard.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;\\r\\n    In half an hour she \\'promis\\'d to return.\\r\\n    Perchance she cannot meet him. That\\'s not so.\\r\\n    O, she is lame! Love\\'s heralds should be thoughts,\\r\\n    Which ten times faster glide than the sun\\'s beams\\r\\n    Driving back shadows over low\\'ring hills.\\r\\n    Therefore do nimble-pinion\\'d doves draw Love,\\r\\n    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\\r\\n    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill\\r\\n    Of this day\\'s journey, and from nine till twelve\\r\\n    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.\\r\\n    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,\\r\\n    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;\\r\\n    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,\\r\\n    And his to me,\\r\\n    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-\\r\\n    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Enter Nurse [and Peter].\\r\\n\\r\\n    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?\\r\\n    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.\\r\\n                                                   [Exit Peter.]\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look\\'st thou sad?\\r\\n    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\\r\\n    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news\\r\\n    By playing it to me with so sour a face.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.\\r\\n    Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.\\r\\n    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?\\r\\n    Do you not see that I am out of breath?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath\\r\\n    To say to me that thou art out of breath?\\r\\n    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay\\r\\n    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\\r\\n    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.\\r\\n    Say either, and I\\'ll stay the circumstance.\\r\\n    Let me be satisfied, is\\'t good or bad?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to\\r\\n    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better\\r\\n    than any man\\'s, yet his leg excels all men\\'s; and for a hand and a\\r\\n    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk\\'d on, yet\\r\\n    they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I\\'ll\\r\\n    warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve\\r\\nGod.\\r\\n    What, have you din\\'d at home?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.\\r\\n    What says he of our marriage? What of that?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\\r\\n    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\\r\\n    My back o\\' t\\' other side,- ah, my back, my back!\\r\\n    Beshrew your heart for sending me about\\r\\n    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I\\' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\\r\\n    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,\\r\\n    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where\\r\\n    is your mother?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.\\r\\n    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!\\r\\n    \\'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\\r\\n    \"Where is your mother?\"\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. O God\\'s Lady dear!\\r\\n    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.\\r\\n    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?\\r\\n    Henceforward do your messages yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Here\\'s such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I have.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence\\' cell;\\r\\n    There stays a husband to make you a wife.\\r\\n    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:\\r\\n    They\\'ll be in scarlet straight at any news.\\r\\n    Hie you to church; I must another way,\\r\\n    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love\\r\\n    Must climb a bird\\'s nest soon when it is dark.\\r\\n    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\\r\\n    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.\\r\\n    Go; I\\'ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.\\r\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene VI.\\r\\nFriar Laurence\\'s cell.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act\\r\\n    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,\\r\\n    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy\\r\\n    That one short minute gives me in her sight.\\r\\n    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,\\r\\n    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-\\r\\n    It is enough I may but call her mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends\\r\\n    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,\\r\\n    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey\\r\\n    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness\\r\\n    And in the taste confounds the appetite.\\r\\n    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\r\\n    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\r\\n\\r\\n                     Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\r\\n    Will ne\\'er wear out the everlasting flint.\\r\\n    A lover may bestride the gossamer\\r\\n    That idles in the wanton summer air,\\r\\n    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\r\\n    Be heap\\'d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\r\\n    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\r\\n    This neighbour air, and let rich music\\'s tongue\\r\\n    Unfold the imagin\\'d happiness that both\\r\\n    Receive in either by this dear encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,\\r\\n    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.\\r\\n    They are but beggars that can count their worth;\\r\\n    But my true love is grown to such excess\\r\\n    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;\\r\\n    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\r\\n    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.\\r\\n                                                       [Exeunt.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT III. Scene I.\\r\\nA public place.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let\\'s retire.\\r\\n    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.\\r\\n    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\\r\\n    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters\\r\\n    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and\\r\\n    says \\'God send me no need of thee!\\' and by the operation of the\\r\\n    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in\\r\\n    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be\\r\\n    moved.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. And what to?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,\\r\\n    for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a\\r\\n    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.\\r\\n    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no\\r\\n    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an\\r\\n    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels\\r\\n    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as\\r\\n    addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell\\'d with a\\r\\n    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog\\r\\n    that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a\\r\\n    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with\\r\\n    another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\r\\n    tutor me from quarrelling!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should\\r\\n    buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. The fee simple? O simple!\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter Tybalt and others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. By my heel, I care not.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.\\r\\n    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. And but one word with one of us?\\r\\n    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me\\r\\n    occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make\\r\\n    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here\\'s my\\r\\n    fiddlestick; here\\'s that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.\\r\\n    Either withdraw unto some private place\\r\\n    And reason coldly of your grievances,\\r\\n    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer. Men\\'s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\r\\n    I will not budge for no man\\'s pleasure,\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer.

Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\r\\n    No better term than this: thou art a villain.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\r\\n    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage\\r\\n    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.\\r\\n    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\r\\n    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I do protest I never injur\\'d thee,\\r\\n    But love thee better than thou canst devise\\r\\n    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;\\r\\n    And so good Capulet, which name I tender\\r\\n    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mer.

Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.\\r\\nThat I\\r\\n    mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,\\r\\n\\r\\n    dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out\\r\\n    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your\\r\\n    ears ere it be out.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tyb. I am for you.

Ask for me to-morrow, and you\\r\\n    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this\\r\\n    world. A plague o\\' both your houses!

Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother\\'s child!\\r\\n    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill\\'d\\r\\n    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\\r\\n    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\\r\\n    O cousin, cousin!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo\\'s hand did stay.\\r\\n    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\\r\\n    How nice the quarrel was, and urg\\'d withal\\r\\n    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered\\r\\n    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow\\'d-\\r\\n    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen\\r\\n    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\r\\n    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio\\'s breast;\\r\\n    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\r\\n    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\r\\n    Cold death aside and with the other sends\\r\\n    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\r\\n    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\r\\n    \\'Hold, friends! friends, part!\\' and swifter than his tongue,\\r\\n    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\r\\n    And \\'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\r\\n    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\r\\n    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;\\r\\n    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,\\r\\n    Who had but newly entertain\\'d revenge,\\r\\n    And to\\'t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\r\\n    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;\\r\\n    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.\\r\\n    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;\\r\\n    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\r\\n    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\r\\n    And all those twenty could but kill one life.\\r\\n    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.\\r\\n    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince.

Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.\\r\\n    Affliction is enanmour\\'d of thy parts,\\r\\n    And thou art wedded to calamity.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Enter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince\\'s doom\\r\\n    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand\\r\\n    That I yet know not?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Too familiar\\r\\n    Is my dear son with such sour company.\\r\\n    I bring thee tidings of the Prince\\'s doom.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince\\'s doom?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish\\'d from his lips-\\r\\n    Not body\\'s death, but body\\'s banishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say \\'death\\';\\r\\n    For exile hath more terror in his look,\\r\\n    Much more than death. Do not say \\'banishment.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.\\r\\n    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,\\r\\n    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.\\r\\n    Hence banished is banish\\'d from the world,\\r\\n    And world\\'s exile is death. Then \\'banishment\\'\\r\\n    Is death misterm\\'d. Calling death \\'banishment,\\'\\r\\n    Thou cut\\'st my head off with a golden axe\\r\\n    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!\\r\\n    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,\\r\\n    Taking thy part, hath rush\\'d aside the law,\\r\\n    And turn\\'d that black word death to banishment.\\r\\n    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. \\'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,\\r\\n    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog\\r\\n    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,\\r\\n    Live here in heaven and may look on her;\\r\\n    But Romeo may not. More validity,\\r\\n    More honourable state, more courtship lives\\r\\n    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\\r\\n    On the white wonder of dear Juliet\\'s hand\\r\\n    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,\\r\\n    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,\\r\\n    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;\\r\\n    But Romeo may not- he is banished.\\r\\n    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;\\r\\n    They are free men, but I am banished.\\r\\n    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?\\r\\n    Hadst thou no poison mix\\'d, no sharp-ground knife,\\r\\n    No sudden mean of death, though ne\\'er so mean,\\r\\n    But \\'banished\\' to kill me- \\'banished\\'?\\r\\n    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;\\r\\n    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,\\r\\n    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,\\r\\n    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess\\'d,\\r\\n    To mangle me with that word \\'banished\\'?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. I\\'ll give thee armour to keep off that word;\\r\\n    Adversity\\'s sweet milk, philosophy,\\r\\n    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Yet \\'banished\\'? Hang up philosophy!\\r\\n    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,\\r\\n    Displant a town, reverse a prince\\'s doom,\\r\\n    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\\r\\n    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\\r\\n    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\\r\\n    Doting like me, and like me banished,\\r\\n    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\\r\\n    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,\\r\\n    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.\\r\\n                                                 Knock [within].\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,\\r\\n    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who\\'s there? Romeo, arise;\\r\\n    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.\\r\\n    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God\\'s will,\\r\\n    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.\\r\\n    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What\\'s your will\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\\r\\n    I come from Lady Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Welcome then.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar\\r\\n    Where is my lady\\'s lord, where\\'s Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress\\' case,\\r\\n    Just in her case!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. O woeful sympathy!\\r\\n    Piteous predicament!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Even so lies she,\\r\\n    Blubb\\'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\\r\\n    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.\\r\\n    For Juliet\\'s sake, for her sake, rise and stand!\\r\\n    Why should you fall into so deep an O?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. (rises) Nurse-\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death\\'s the end of all.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\\r\\n    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,\\r\\n    Now I have stain\\'d the childhood of our joy\\r\\n    With blood remov\\'d but little from her own?\\r\\n    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says\\r\\n    My conceal\\'d lady to our cancell\\'d love?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\\r\\n    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\\r\\n    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,\\r\\n    And then down falls again.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. As if that name,\\r\\n    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,\\r\\n    Did murther her; as that name\\'s cursed hand\\r\\n    Murder\\'d her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,\\r\\n    In what vile part of this anatomy\\r\\n    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\\r\\n    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.\\r\\n    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;\\r\\n    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\\r\\n    The unreasonable fury of a beast.\\r\\n    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!\\r\\n    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\\r\\n    Thou hast amaz\\'d me. By my holy order,\\r\\n    I thought thy disposition better temper\\'d.\\r\\n    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\\r\\n    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,\\r\\n    By doing damned hate upon thyself?\\r\\n    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?\\r\\n    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet\\r\\n    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\\r\\n    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\\r\\n    Which, like a usurer, abound\\'st in all,\\r\\n    And usest none in that true use indeed\\r\\n    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\\r\\n    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax\\r\\n    Digressing from the valour of a man;\\r\\n    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\\r\\n    Killing that love which thou hast vow\\'d to cherish;\\r\\n    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\\r\\n    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,\\r\\n    Like powder in a skilless soldier\\'s flask,\\r\\n    is get afire by thine own ignorance,\\r\\n    And thou dismemb\\'red with thine own defence.\\r\\n    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,\\r\\n    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\\r\\n    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\\r\\n    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.\\r\\n    The law, that threat\\'ned death, becomes thy friend\\r\\n    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.\\r\\n    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;\\r\\n    Happiness courts thee in her best array;\\r\\n    But, like a misbhav\\'d and sullen wench,\\r\\n    Thou pout\\'st upon thy fortune and thy love.\\r\\n    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\\r\\n    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,\\r\\n    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\\r\\n    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,\\r\\n    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,\\r\\n    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time\\r\\n    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\\r\\n    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\\r\\n    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy\\r\\n    Than thou went\\'st forth in lamentation.\\r\\n    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\\r\\n    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,\\r\\n    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\\r\\n    Romeo is coming.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay\\'d here all the night\\r\\n    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\\r\\n    My lord, I\\'ll tell my lady you will come.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.\\r\\n    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv\\'d by this!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:\\r\\n    Either be gone before the watch be set,\\r\\n    Or by the break of day disguis\\'d from hence.\\r\\n    Sojourn in Mantua. I\\'ll find out your man,\\r\\n    And he shall signify from time to time\\r\\n    Every good hap to you that chances here.\\r\\n    Give me thy hand. \\'Tis late. Farewell; good night.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,\\r\\n    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.\\r\\n    Farewell.\\r\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene IV.\\r\\nCapulet\\'s house\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Things have fall\\'n out, sir, so unluckily\\r\\n    That we have had no time to move our daughter.\\r\\n    Look you, she lov\\'d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\\r\\n    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.\\r\\n    \\'Tis very late; she\\'ll not come down to-night.\\r\\n    I promise you, but for your company,\\r\\n    I would have been abed an hour ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.\\r\\n    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;\\r\\n    To-night she\\'s mew\\'d up to her heaviness.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\\r\\n    Of my child\\'s love. I think she will be rul\\'d\\r\\n    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\\r\\n    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;\\r\\n    Acquaint her here of my son Paris\\' love\\r\\n    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-\\r\\n    But, soft! what day is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Monday, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.\\r\\n    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her\\r\\n    She shall be married to this noble earl.\\r\\n    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?\\r\\n    We\\'ll keep no great ado- a friend or two;\\r\\n    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\\r\\n    It may be thought we held him carelessly,\\r\\n    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.\\r\\n    Therefore we\\'ll have some half a dozen friends,\\r\\n    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.\\r\\n    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;\\r\\n    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.\\r\\n    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!\\r\\n    Afore me, It is so very very late\\r\\n    That we may call it early by-and-by.\\r\\n    Good night.\\r\\n                                                          Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene V.\\r\\nCapulet\\'s orchard.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\\r\\n    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,\\r\\n    That pierc\\'d the fearful hollow of thine ear.\\r\\n    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\\r\\n    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;\\r\\n    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\\r\\n    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.\\r\\n    Night\\'s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\\r\\n    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\\r\\n    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.\\r\\n    It is some meteor that the sun exhales\\r\\n    To be to thee this night a torchbearer\\r\\n    And light thee on the way to Mantua.\\r\\n    Therefore stay yet; thou need\\'st not to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Let me be ta\\'en, let me be put to death.\\r\\n    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.\\r\\n    I\\'ll say yon grey is not the morning\\'s eye,\\r\\n    \\'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia\\'s brow;\\r\\n    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\\r\\n    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\\r\\n    I have more care to stay than will to go.\\r\\n    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.\\r\\n    How is\\'t, my soul? Let\\'s talk; it is not day.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!\\r\\n    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,\\r\\n    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\\r\\n    Some say the lark makes sweet division;\\r\\n    This doth not so, for she divideth us.\\r\\n    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang\\'d eyes;\\r\\n    O, now I would they had chang\\'d voices too,\\r\\n    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\\r\\n    Hunting thee hence with hunt\\'s-up to the day!\\r\\n    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Enter Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Madam!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Nurse?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.\\r\\n    The day is broke; be wary, look about.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.\\r\\n                                                         [Exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I\\'ll descend.\\r\\n                                                  He goeth down.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?\\r\\n    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,\\r\\n    For in a minute there are many days.\\r\\n    O, by this count I shall be much in years\\r\\n    Ere I again behold my Romeo!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Farewell!\\r\\n    I will omit no opportunity\\r\\n    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. O, think\\'st thou we shall ever meet again?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve\\r\\n    For sweet discourses in our time to come.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!\\r\\n    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,\\r\\n    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\\r\\n    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look\\'st pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\\r\\n    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!\\r\\nExit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.\\r\\n    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\\r\\n    That is renown\\'d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,\\r\\n    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long\\r\\n    But send him back.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Who is\\'t that calls? It is my lady mother.\\r\\n    Is she not down so late, or up so early?\\r\\n    What unaccustom\\'d cause procures her hither?\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter Mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Madam, I am not well.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin\\'s death?\\r\\n    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\\r\\n    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\\r\\n    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;\\r\\n    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\\r\\n    Which you weep for.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Feeling so the loss,\\r\\n    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep\\'st not so much for his death\\r\\n    As that the villain lives which slaughter\\'d him.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. What villain, madam?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. That same villain Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-\\r\\n    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;\\r\\n    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.\\r\\n    Would none but I might venge my cousin\\'s death!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\\r\\n    Then weep no more. I\\'ll send to one in Mantua,\\r\\n    Where that same banish\\'d runagate doth live,\\r\\n    Shall give him such an unaccustom\\'d dram\\r\\n    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;\\r\\n    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied\\r\\n    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-\\r\\n    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex\\'d.\\r\\n    Madam, if you could find out but a man\\r\\n    To bear a poison, I would temper it;\\r\\n    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\\r\\n    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\\r\\n    To hear him nam\\'d and cannot come to him,\\r\\n    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt\\r\\n    Upon his body that hath slaughter\\'d him!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. Find thou the means, and I\\'ll find such a man.\\r\\n    But now I\\'ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.\\r\\n    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\\r\\n    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,\\r\\n    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy\\r\\n    That thou expects not nor I look\\'d not for.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn\\r\\n    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\\r\\n    The County Paris, at Saint Peter\\'s Church,\\r\\n    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Now by Saint Peter\\'s Church, and Peter too,\\r\\n    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!\\r\\n    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed\\r\\n    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.\\r\\n    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\\r\\n    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\\r\\n    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\\r\\n    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,\\r\\n    And see how he will take it at your hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,\\r\\n    But for the sunset of my brother\\'s son\\r\\n    It rains downright.\\r\\n    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\\r\\n    Evermore show\\'ring? In one little body\\r\\n    Thou counterfeit\\'st a bark, a sea, a wind:\\r\\n    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\\r\\n    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is\\r\\n    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,\\r\\n    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,\\r\\n    Without a sudden calm will overset\\r\\n    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\\r\\n    Have you delivered to her our decree?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\\r\\n    I would the fool were married to her grave!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.\\r\\n    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\\r\\n    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\\r\\n    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought\\r\\n    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.\\r\\n    Proud can I never be of what I hate,\\r\\n    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?\\r\\n    \\'Proud\\'- and \\'I thank you\\'- and \\'I thank you not\\'-\\r\\n    And yet \\'not proud\\'? Mistress minion you,\\r\\n    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\\r\\n    But fettle your fine joints \\'gainst Thursday next\\r\\n    To go with Paris to Saint Peter\\'s Church,\\r\\n    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\\r\\n    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!\\r\\n    You tallow-face!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,\\r\\n    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!\\r\\n    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday\\r\\n    Or never after look me in the face.\\r\\n    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!\\r\\n    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest\\r\\n    That God had lent us but this only child;\\r\\n    But now I see this one is one too much,\\r\\n    And that we have a curse in having her.\\r\\n    Out on her, hilding!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!\\r\\n    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,\\r\\n    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. I speak no treason.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse. May not one speak?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!\\r\\n    Utter your gravity o\\'er a gossip\\'s bowl,\\r\\n    For here we need it not.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. You are too hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap.

Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt\\'s death,\\r\\n    And therefore have I little talk\\'d of love;\\r\\n    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\\r\\n    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous\\r\\n    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,\\r\\n    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage\\r\\n    To stop the inundation of her tears,\\r\\n    Which, too much minded by herself alone,\\r\\n    May be put from her by society.\\r\\n    Now do you know the reason of this haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow\\'d.-\\r\\n    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Enter Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. What must be shall be.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. That\\'s a certain text.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,\\r\\n    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus\\'d with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,\\r\\n    For it was bad enough before their spite.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Thou wrong\\'st it more than tears with that report.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;\\r\\n    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland\\'red it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.\\r\\n    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,\\r\\n    Or shall I come to you at evening mass\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\\r\\n    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!\\r\\n    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.\\r\\n    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\\r\\n    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\\r\\n    It strains me past the compass of my wits.\\r\\n    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\\r\\n    On Thursday next be married to this County.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear\\'st of this,\\r\\n    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\\r\\n    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\\r\\n    Do thou but call my resolution wise\\r\\n    And with this knife I\\'ll help it presently.\\r\\n    God join\\'d my heart and Romeo\\'s, thou our hands;\\r\\n    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo\\'s seal\\'d,\\r\\n    Shall be the label to another deed,\\r\\n    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt\\r\\n    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.\\r\\n    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc\\'d time,\\r\\n    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,\\r\\n    \\'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\\r\\n    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that\\r\\n    Which the commission of thy years and art\\r\\n    Could to no issue of true honour bring.\\r\\n    Be not so long to speak. I long to die\\r\\n    If what thou speak\\'st speak not of remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\\r\\n    Which craves as desperate an execution\\r\\n    As that is desperate which we would prevent.\\r\\n    If, rather than to marry County Paris\\r\\n    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\\r\\n    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake\\r\\n    A thing like death to chide away this shame,\\r\\n    That cop\\'st with death himself to scape from it;\\r\\n    And, if thou dar\\'st, I\\'ll give thee remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\\r\\n    From off the battlements of yonder tower,\\r\\n    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\\r\\n    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,\\r\\n    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,\\r\\n    O\\'ercover\\'d quite with dead men\\'s rattling bones,\\r\\n    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\\r\\n    Or bid me go into a new-made grave\\r\\n    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-\\r\\n    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-\\r\\n    And I will do it without fear or doubt,\\r\\n    To live an unstain\\'d wife to my sweet love.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent\\r\\n    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.\\r\\n    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\\r\\n    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\\r\\n    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,\\r\\n    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;\\r\\n    When presently through all thy veins shall run\\r\\n    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\\r\\n    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;\\r\\n    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\\r\\n    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\\r\\n    To paly ashes, thy eyes\\' windows fall\\r\\n    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;\\r\\n    Each part, depriv\\'d of supple government,\\r\\n    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;\\r\\n    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death\\r\\n    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,\\r\\n    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\\r\\n    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\\r\\n    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\\r\\n    Then, as the manner of our country is,\\r\\n    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier\\r\\n    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\\r\\n    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\\r\\n    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\\r\\n    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;\\r\\n    And hither shall he come; and he and I\\r\\n    Will watch thy waking, and that very night\\r\\n    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\\r\\n    And this shall free thee from this present shame,\\r\\n    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\\r\\n    Abate thy valour in the acting it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous\\r\\n    In this resolve. I\\'ll send a friar with speed\\r\\n    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.\\r\\n    Farewell, dear father.\\r\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene II.\\r\\nCapulet\\'s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,\\r\\n                        two or three.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap.

You shall have none ill, sir; for I\\'ll try if they can\\r\\n    lick their fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. How canst thou try them so?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Serv. Marry, sir, \\'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own\\r\\n    fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not\\r\\n    with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. Go, begone.\\r\\n                                                Exit Servingman.\\r\\n    We shall be much unfurnish\\'d for this time.\\r\\n    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Nurse.

Musicians, O, musicians, \\'Heart\\'s ease,\\' \\'Heart\\'s ease\\'!\\r\\n    O, an you will have me live, play \\'Heart\\'s ease.\\'\\r\\n  1. Mus. Why \\'Heart\\'s ease\\'\\',\\r\\n\\r\\n  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays \\'My heart is\\r\\n    full of woe.\\' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.\\r\\n  1. Mus. Not a dump we! \\'Tis no time to play now.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Pet. You will not then?\\r\\n  1. Mus. No.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.\\r\\n  1. Mus. What will you give us?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the\\r\\n     minstrel.\\r\\n  1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature\\'s dagger on your pate.\\r\\n    I will carry no crotchets. I\\'ll re you, I\\'ll fa you. Do you\\r\\n    note me?\\r\\n  1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.\\r\\n  2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Pet. Then have at you with my wit!

Faith, I know not what to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you.

Scene I.\\r\\nMantua. A street.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep\\r\\n    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.\\r\\n    My bosom\\'s lord sits lightly in his throne,\\r\\n    And all this day an unaccustom\\'d spirit\\r\\n    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.\\r\\n    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead\\r\\n    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)\\r\\n    And breath\\'d such life with kisses in my lips\\r\\n    That I reviv\\'d and was an emperor.\\r\\n    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess\\'d,\\r\\n    When but love\\'s shadows are so rich in joy!\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter Romeo\\'s Man Balthasar, booted.\\r\\n\\r\\n    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?\\r\\n    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?\\r\\n    How doth my lady? Is my father well?\\r\\n    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,\\r\\n    For nothing can be ill if she be well.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.\\r\\n    Her body sleeps in Capel\\'s monument,\\r\\n    And her immortal part with angels lives.\\r\\n    I saw her laid low in her kindred\\'s vault\\r\\n    And presently took post to tell it you.\\r\\n    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,\\r\\n    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Is it e\\'en so? Then I defy you, stars!\\r\\n    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper\\r\\n    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.\\r\\n    Your looks are pale and wild and do import\\r\\n    Some misadventure.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv\\'d.\\r\\n    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.\\r\\n    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Man. No, my good lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone\\r\\n    And hire those horses. I\\'ll be with thee straight.\\r\\n                                               Exit [Balthasar].\\r\\n    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.\\r\\n    Let\\'s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift\\r\\n    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!\\r\\n    I do remember an apothecary,\\r\\n    And hereabouts \\'a dwells, which late I noted\\r\\n    In tatt\\'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,\\r\\n    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,\\r\\n    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;\\r\\n    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\\r\\n    An alligator stuff\\'d, and other skins\\r\\n    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\\r\\n    A beggarly account of empty boxes,\\r\\n    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\\r\\n    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\\r\\n    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.\\r\\n    Noting this penury, to myself I said,\\r\\n    \\'An if a man did need a poison now\\r\\n    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,\\r\\n    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\\'\\r\\n    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,\\r\\n    And this same needy man must sell it me.\\r\\n    As I remember, this should be the house.\\r\\n    Being holiday, the beggar\\'s shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter Apothecary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Apoth. Who calls so loud?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\\r\\n    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\\r\\n    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\\r\\n    As will disperse itself through all the veins\\r\\n    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,\\r\\n    And that the trunk may be discharg\\'d of breath\\r\\n    As violently as hasty powder fir\\'d\\r\\n    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon\\'s womb.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua\\'s law\\r\\n    Is death to any he that utters them.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness\\r\\n    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\\r\\n    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\\r\\n    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:\\r\\n    The world is not thy friend, nor the world\\'s law;\\r\\n    The world affords no law to make thee rich;\\r\\n    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will\\r\\n    And drink it off, and if you had the strength\\r\\n    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men\\'s souls,\\r\\n    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,\\r\\n    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\\r\\n    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.\\r\\n    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.\\r\\n    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me\\r\\n    To Juliet\\'s grave; for there must I use thee.\\r\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene II.\\r\\nVerona. Friar Laurence\\'s cell.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Friar John to Friar Laurence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Enter Friar Laurence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.\\r\\n    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?\\r\\n    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,\\r\\n    One of our order, to associate me\\r\\n    Here in this city visiting the sick,\\r\\n    And finding him, the searchers of the town,\\r\\n    Suspecting that we both were in a house\\r\\n    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,\\r\\n    Seal\\'d up the doors, and would not let us forth,\\r\\n    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay\\'d.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\n  John. I could not send it- here it is again-\\r\\n    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,\\r\\n    So fearful were they of infection.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\\r\\n    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,\\r\\n    Of dear import; and the neglecting it\\r\\n    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,\\r\\n    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight\\r\\n    Unto my cell.\\r\\n\\r\\n  John. Brother, I\\'ll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.\\r\\n    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\\r\\n    She will beshrew me much that Romeo\\r\\n    Hath had no notice of these accidents;\\r\\n    But I will write again to Mantua,\\r\\n    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-\\r\\n    Poor living corse, clos\\'d in a dead man\\'s tomb!        Exit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScene III.\\r\\nVerona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.\\r\\n    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.\\r\\n    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,\\r\\n    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.\\r\\n    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread\\r\\n    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)\\r\\n    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,\\r\\n    As signal that thou hear\\'st something approach.\\r\\n    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone\\r\\n    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew\\r\\n    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)\\r\\n    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;\\r\\n    Or, wanting that, with tears distill\\'d by moans.\\r\\n    The obsequies that I for thee will keep\\r\\n    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.\\r\\n                                                    Whistle Boy.\\r\\n    The boy gives warning something doth approach.\\r\\n    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night\\r\\n    To cross my obsequies and true love\\'s rite?\\r\\n    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]\\r\\n\\r\\n       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,\\r\\n                    and a crow of iron.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\\r\\n    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning\\r\\n    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.\\r\\n    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,\\r\\n    Whate\\'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof\\r\\n    And do not interrupt me in my course.\\r\\n    Why I descend into this bed of death\\r\\n    Is partly to behold my lady\\'s face,\\r\\n    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\\r\\n    A precious ring- a ring that I must use\\r\\n    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\\r\\n    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry\\r\\n    In what I farther shall intend to do,\\r\\n    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint\\r\\n    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\\r\\n    The time and my intents are savage-wild,\\r\\n    More fierce and more inexorable far\\r\\n    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\\r\\n    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I\\'ll hide me hereabout.\\r\\n    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\\r\\n    Gorg\\'d with the dearest morsel of the earth,\\r\\n    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\\r\\n    And in despite I\\'ll cram thee with more food.\\r\\n                                           Romeo opens the tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. This is that banish\\'d haughty Montague\\r\\n    That murd\\'red my love\\'s cousin- with which grief\\r\\n    It is supposed the fair creature died-\\r\\n    And here is come to do some villanous shame\\r\\n    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\\r\\n    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!\\r\\n    Can vengeance be pursu\\'d further than death?\\r\\n    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\\r\\n    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\\r\\n    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp\\'rate man.\\r\\n    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\\r\\n    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\\r\\n    But not another sin upon my head\\r\\n    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!\\r\\n    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,\\r\\n    For I come hither arm\\'d against myself.\\r\\n    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say\\r\\n    A madman\\'s mercy bid thee run away.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration\\r\\n    And apprehend thee for a felon here.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\\r\\n                                                     They fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\\r\\n                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]\\r\\n\\r\\n  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,\\r\\n    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\\r\\n    Mercutio\\'s kinsman, noble County Paris!\\r\\n    What said my man when my betossed soul\\r\\n    Did not attend him as we rode? I think\\r\\n    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.\\r\\n    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?\\r\\n    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet\\r\\n    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\\r\\n    One writ with me in sour misfortune\\'s book!\\r\\n    I\\'ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\\r\\n    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught\\'red youth,\\r\\n    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\r\\n    This vault a feasting presence full of light.\\r\\n    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr\\'d.\\r\\n                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]\\r\\n    How oft when men are at the point of death\\r\\n    Have they been merry! which their keepers call\\r\\n    A lightning before death. O, how may I\\r\\n    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!\\r\\n    Death, that hath suck\\'d the honey of thy breath,\\r\\n    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\\r\\n    Thou art not conquer\\'d. Beauty\\'s ensign yet\\r\\n    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\r\\n    And death\\'s pale flag is not advanced there.\\r\\n    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\r\\n    O, what more favour can I do to thee\\r\\n    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\r\\n    To sunder his that was thine enemy?\\r\\n    Forgive me, cousin.\\' Ah, dear Juliet,\\r\\n    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\\r\\n    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,\\r\\n    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\r\\n    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?\\r\\n    For fear of that I still will stay with thee\\r\\n    And never from this palace of dim night\\r\\n    Depart again. Here, here will I remain\\r\\n    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\\r\\n    Will I set up my everlasting rest\\r\\n    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\r\\n    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\\r\\n    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\\r\\n    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\r\\n    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!\\r\\n    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!\\r\\n    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\r\\n    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!\\r\\n    Here\\'s to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!\\r\\n    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\\r\\n    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who\\'s there?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Bal. Here\\'s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,\\r\\n    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light\\r\\n    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\\r\\n    It burneth in the Capels\\' monument.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there\\'s my master,\\r\\n    One that you love.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Who is it?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Bal. Romeo.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. How long hath he been there?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Bal. Full half an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Go with me to the vault.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Bal. I dare not, sir.\\r\\n    My master knows not but I am gone hence,\\r\\n    And fearfully did menace me with death\\r\\n    If I did stay to look on his intents.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Stay then; I\\'ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\\r\\n    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,\\r\\n    I dreamt my master and another fought,\\r\\n    And that my master slew him.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. Romeo!\\r\\n    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains\\r\\n    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?\\r\\n    What mean these masterless and gory swords\\r\\n    To lie discolour\\'d by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]\\r\\n    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\\r\\n    And steep\\'d in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour\\r\\n    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.\\r\\n                                                   Juliet rises.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?\\r\\n    I do remember well where I should be,\\r\\n    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\\r\\n    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\\r\\n    A greater power than we can contradict\\r\\n    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\\r\\n    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\\r\\n    And Paris too. Come, I\\'ll dispose of thee\\r\\n    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.\\r\\n    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.\\r\\n    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.\\r\\n                                                   Exit [Friar].\\r\\n    What\\'s here? A cup, clos\\'d in my true love\\'s hand?\\r\\n    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\\r\\n    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop\\r\\n    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.\\r\\n    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them\\r\\n    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]\\r\\n    Thy lips are warm!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?\\r\\n    Yea, noise? Then I\\'ll be brief. O happy dagger!\\r\\n                                      [Snatches Romeo\\'s dagger.]\\r\\n    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.\\r\\n                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo\\'s body].\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter [Paris\\'s] Boy and Watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Chief Watch. \\'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.\\r\\n    Go, some of you; whoe\\'er you find attach.\\r\\n                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]\\r\\n    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;\\r\\n    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\\r\\n    Who here hath lain this two days buried.\\r\\n    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;\\r\\n    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.\\r\\n                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]\\r\\n    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\\r\\n    But the true ground of all these piteous woes\\r\\n    We cannot without circumstance descry.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo\\'s Man [Balthasar].\\r\\n\\r\\n  2. Watch. Here\\'s Romeo\\'s man. We found him in the churchyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\\r\\n\\r\\n          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\\r\\n    We took this mattock and this spade from him\\r\\n    As he was coming from this churchyard side.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,\\r\\n    That calls our person from our morning rest?\\r\\n\\r\\n            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. The people in the street cry \\'Romeo,\\'\\r\\n    Some \\'Juliet,\\' and some \\'Paris\\'; and all run,\\r\\n    With open outcry, toward our monument.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;\\r\\n    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,\\r\\n    Warm and new kill\\'d.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter\\'d Romeo\\'s man,\\r\\n    With instruments upon them fit to open\\r\\n    These dead men\\'s tombs.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\\r\\n    This dagger hath mista\\'en, for, lo, his house\\r\\n    Is empty on the back of Montague,\\r\\n    And it missheathed in my daughter\\'s bosom!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell\\r\\n    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Enter Montague [and others].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up\\r\\n    To see thy son and heir more early down.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!\\r\\n    Grief of my son\\'s exile hath stopp\\'d her breath.\\r\\n    What further woe conspires against mine age?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,\\r\\n    To press before thy father to a grave?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\\r\\n    Till we can clear these ambiguities\\r\\n    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;\\r\\n    And then will I be general of your woes\\r\\n    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\\r\\n    And let mischance be slave to patience.\\r\\n    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,\\r\\n    Yet most suspected, as the time and place\\r\\n    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;\\r\\n    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge\\r\\n    Myself condemned and myself excus\\'d.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath\\r\\n    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.\\r\\n    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;\\r\\n    And she, there dead, that Romeo\\'s faithful wife.\\r\\n    I married them; and their stol\\'n marriage day\\r\\n    Was Tybalt\\'s doomsday, whose untimely death\\r\\n    Banish\\'d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\\r\\n    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin\\'d.\\r\\n    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,\\r\\n    Betroth\\'d and would have married her perforce\\r\\n    To County Paris. Then comes she to me\\r\\n    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean\\r\\n    To rid her from this second marriage,\\r\\n    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.\\r\\n    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)\\r\\n    A sleeping potion; which so took effect\\r\\n    As I intended, for it wrought on her\\r\\n    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\r\\n    That he should hither come as this dire night\\r\\n    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,\\r\\n    Being the time the potion\\'s force should cease.\\r\\n    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\r\\n    Was stay\\'d by accident, and yesternight\\r\\n    Return\\'d my letter back. Then all alone\\r\\n    At the prefixed hour of her waking\\r\\n    Came I to take her from her kindred\\'s vault;\\r\\n    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell\\r\\n    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\r\\n    But when I came, some minute ere the time\\r\\n    Of her awaking, here untimely lay\\r\\n    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\r\\n    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\r\\n    And bear this work of heaven with patience;\\r\\n    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\\r\\n    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\r\\n    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\r\\n    All this I know, and to the marriage\\r\\n    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this\\r\\n    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\\r\\n    Be sacrific\\'d, some hour before his time,\\r\\n    Unto the rigour of severest law.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.\\r\\n    Where\\'s Romeo\\'s man? What can he say in this?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet\\'s death;\\r\\n    And then in post he came from Mantua\\r\\n    To this same place, to this same monument.\\r\\n    This letter he early bid me give his father,\\r\\n    And threat\\'ned me with death, going in the vault,\\r\\n    If I departed not and left him there.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.\\r\\n    Where is the County\\'s page that rais\\'d the watch?\\r\\n    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady\\'s grave;\\r\\n    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\r\\n    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\\r\\n    And by-and-by my master drew on him;\\r\\n    And then I ran away to call the watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar\\'s words,\\r\\n    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;\\r\\n    And here he writes that he did buy a poison\\r\\n    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal\\r\\n    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\r\\n    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,\\r\\n    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\r\\n    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\r\\n    And I, for winking at you, discords too,\\r\\n    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish\\'d.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\r\\n    This is my daughter\\'s jointure, for no more\\r\\n    Can I demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mon. But I can give thee more;\\r\\n    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,\\r\\n    That whiles Verona by that name is known,\\r\\n    There shall no figure at such rate be set\\r\\n    As that of true and faithful Juliet.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cap. As rich shall Romeo\\'s by his lady\\'s lie-\\r\\n    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\\r\\n    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\r\\n    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\\r\\n    Some shall be pardon\\'d, and some punished;\\r\\n    For never was a story of more woe\\r\\n    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\r\\n                                                   Exeunt omnes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMEO AND JULIET ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 1112.txt or 1112.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/1/1112/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'\n"
